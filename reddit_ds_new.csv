redfall,">People also aren't a doofus for cutting down nonsense complaints and pointing out hypocrites. It's because it's an Xbox title.

Fair enough, and agreed. But at the moment you're talking to people who wanted this game to succeed and gave it a fair shot. Sometimes a bad game is a just a bad game.

&#x200B;

>Starfield is STILL getting flack despite just having an amazing showcase all because it's 30FPS.....

I mean, that's fair, i'd be slightly annoyed if I was forced to play at 30fps on my next gen console. Luckily I don't restrict myself to a single platform.

>You don't truly hope for anything positive.

Haha wow, I was soooooo close to respecting your point of view until I read that garbage. I love Arkane games, and I love looter shooters but this isn't it. I hope it shapes up so I can give this one another playthrough but we all know this is gonna be a few patches and move onto the next project type deal.

>Half the guy's list was stuff that is being worked on, can be worked on or was literally a preference/nitpick.

Should have never released like this to begin with, dude was simply sharing his experience with the game, and gripes. Most of if not all of them are valid.

killteam,"I'm not sure I agree here quite honestly. Easy to play does not mean easy to enjoy. When you spend most of the first games getting shot at by accident (like I did and the folks I've taught), you'll quickly lose your 4 operatives especially if you're not just learning with other new folks. More often than not, folks are getting into the game in a pre-established community at their LGS where people will just be better at using the cover system.

Death Guard have 2 more models and are much more forgiving with their 5+ FNP. While I understand the point is to onboard folks into the game and not hand them Phobos or Wyrmblade right away (as you mentioned), 4 Custodes feels like a trap that can bully folks out of the game. Custodes aren't winning tournaments because they're easy to win with neccessarily. I just worry that 4 Custodes might boom players faster than another easy team due to their highly prized models (which new players will lose faster).

Despite this feedback, I'm really happy to see more opinions on Kill Team out on the internet. No matter what folks think, the more content and conversations we have out in the wild for folks to interact with means the more folks thinking about the game and propelling it forward. Having just one YouTube video or Goonhammer article with a take on a topic like this doesn't help new players - this does, though.",NickNightrader,1686611684.0

mullvadvpn,"If you're trying to seed, not having port forwarding doesn't make seeding impossible, it just makes it a lot harder since you cannot connect to closed port peers, only open port peers. So, it's highly recommended you have it. 

If you don't care about seeding (though you should, since p2p relies on it), then you wouldn't really need to bother with it.

It's still sad thinking about Mullvad dropping port forwarding, I was a user of Mullvad for about 2 years. I swapped to AirVPN at first, but refunded and swapped over to ProtonVPN for port forwarding since AirVPN doesn't have a big server network and I'd often start with fast speeds and then go to a crawl due to the low infrastructure.

I was living in Japan in 2008, and remember when I first saw Hakuouki on the shelves.  Didn't actually buy it at that time because... honestly I went to that game shop a lot and was kind of familiar with the clerks there and didn't want them to think I was into stuff Like That. (Ahh, the follies of youth.  When you get closer to 40 you slowly start to lose the ability to feel shame.)  However, when I was a couple weeks from moving out of Japan I finally decided to get it!  I went to the game shop and... it wasn't in stock.  That was the end of that. (Kind of sad honestly I bet I would have loved it since at the time my favorite manga was Kaze Hikaru.)  I just kind of forgot about otome games after that.

I started playing them for real in 2020, and I'm still not entirely sure what led me to it.  Partially because I loved Mass Effect and just wanted more romance in my games like that.  Partially because I wanted to make a romance game of my own and wanted to see what else was out there (as research.)  However, I've kind of concluded there were two main things involved in it.  One, I was really deep into Granblue and had seen a comment from some ass on reddit saying that women need to stop asking for guys in the game since the game was for men only and girls should just go play ""fucking otome games or whatever.""  This annoyed me greatly of course but I guess it planted a seed somewhere in my head because a week later I saw Hakuouki for sale on PC and I thought ""It's on PC??????"" and also ""Wait maybe I should finally do the thing I wanted to do *twelve years ago*.""  It's just been a downhill slide since then.

My understanding is the community hasn't found the kernel hook to pull it off yet on Tensor kernels.

As I'm kind of discussing with devs in real time, I believe Tensor can do it, because Pixel stock firmware has a ""limit charging mode"" that kicks in and holds charge at 80% after four days of being persistently plugged in.

For Qualcomm devices, this is one of the biggest feature adds since LineageOS debuted. It may pressure Google to finally make hold charging a mandatory CDD feature. This is why LineageOS is so important as a bulkhead of the AOSP community.",chrisprice,1686596297.0

PropagandaPosters,"Obviously there is no reason to generalize on every priest, because it would be misguided by me, but let's put things clear here.

First, the entirety of the church had given their explicit endorsement of the Tsar and any action he did, so by logic they endorsed anything done in his name, so by association they all at least gave defense to pogroms and the autocratic regime (not very different from what the church was doing in many other monarchies in history, and that was a reason for both Liberals and Socialists to burn churches and kill priests).

Second, even if that hadn't been the case, which given how the Russian Orthodox church worked, it was, that wouldn't take away the fact that an overwhelming majority supported both absolutism, the black hundreds and the pogroms, to put an example on similar things on democratic regimes, not every soldier here in Argentina supported the dictatorship, but our constitution explicitely says that it doesn't matter, that the ""I was just following orders"" defense doesn't matter and if you took part on the regime you can be jailed.

SiegeAcademy,"The only key-binds I recommend changing are:

Swap walk and prone around; walk on ctrl and prone on alt. 

Reason being, you are only going to be either running or walking at one time, and the pinky is easiest to hit these two with. 

Prone on alt reduces the old accidental prone, and I like to be able to hit crouch (on C) and prone with my thumb. 

I don‚Äôt recommend changing lean binds, and avoid putting anything you regularly use on your mouse buttons. The reason for that is switching your grip to hit the buttons can affect your aim. The worst thing you can do imo is put your lean buttons on your mouse. I have my first mouse button as secondary gadget and second as ping. 

I have also altered some of the camera and drone binds to make them a little easier to hit without stretching my hand. Doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay but just makes things a little more convenient so I‚Äôd recommend it.",mattycmckee,1686593997.0

lepin,"Sounds sketchy imo. That use to be a popular excuse given to buyers when sellers had never sent it out in the first place. It doesnt happen so much any more because sellers arent that bad anymore, and their supply chains are much more reliable. I guess a few still exist like that.

Its used to buy more time until they do send it (some sellers dont actually have all sets in inventory at all times and order from distributor when they sell one), or when they just didnt send it all all due to laziness or error.

Tracking will almost alwats update eventually if it has been sent. Even the worst of them. No updated tracking means the number never got used outside if being issued once to appease the AliExpress system. 

Imo, if your tracking doesnt update within a week, and shown as moving around, I would contact them and tell them you are filing a dispute for goods not received. That usually lights a fire and they will either make sure it gets sent, or cancel the order if they are still stalling.

Also, if this is an AE seller, make sure you keep an eye on the dispute window to file. Once you are outside of that you cant do anything and the seller gets to keep your money whether you received it or not. Some sketchy sellers will try to string you along until its too late to file a dispute. Sticking to high %rated sellers minimizes this risk (97%+).

Good luck to you!",Metron_Seijin,1686595926.0
asianamerican,"It's a difficult balancing act imo. While you are right that he often plays into asian stereotypes, he's also short and ""funny"" so his options are limited in what roles he can get. The issue isn't with him imo, but with Hollywood broadly. In an ideal world, jimmy can play those stereotypical roles because there are tall good looking asian actors also getting equally many jobs. Then when jimmy does his thing, it's not a typical Chinese immigrant, but a nuanced character from China. I just don't like the idea of saying he's not allowed to work because he's short and not the best looking guy.

ThatsInsane,"You and I both know that ""emulation"" is only one aspect of the artistic process. You and I both know that even though trends and aesthetics are recycled, each cycle puts a unique and conscious spin on the reused concepts to adapt it for a contemporary audience.

You and I both know this because we're both adults. 

Let me try to explain what I mean with an analogy: remember the early 2000s? Imagine if we had a perfect AI movie maker in the early 2000s. Now imagine we've had it for a few decades, and because of that no one's made any movies, shows, books, even commercials since the AI became prominent in 1965. Everything after that has been AI generated. If you want you can imagine an alien gave us this AI or something. 
Now I want you to honestly consider if you would have been content watching infinite variable content emulated entirely from films/books/TV made at least 35 years ago. It's all new, there's variety, there's novelty, they've even worked modern slang into the dialogue. But the lives the characters lead, the cinematic styles employed, the plots, the values and morals are all emulations of what was popular when your parents were small children, if not emulations of things that were popular before they were born.

And the truth is unless you're doing summer vacation in philly, you won't be on 95 there. 95 runs straight through the city, NJTP, 276, and to a lesser extent 295 all form a proto-ring road around the city. The vast majority of non-PA bound traffic will be taking the NJTP anyway, that's actually the main artery northbound in this one area. In all honesty, it's probably the single best part of 95 for this to happen to on the entire NY-DC stretch.

And the effect is exactly what you would expect given this situation - surface road traffic is a lot higher (because this stretch of 95 is mostly used by locals) but the actual highway traffic hasn't been too bad. Took about an extra 10 minutes for my friend to get from north Philly to NJ this morning for work. 295 and NJTP had the standard amount of traffic around rush hour.

I don't have Borderlands 3, but I have used CE on Borderlands 2. 
if you change your badass points, it affects all characters. if you just change the unlocked inventory slot or level, that only affects the character you are using. Ammo wise should also only affect your character as you aren't transferring weapons between characters.

If you're asking about if you use CE will it affect other players in your game in a co-op game, then it depends on what you're doing. generally anything you do to your character doesn't always affect other players. a lot of the time, you have to be the host to make some cheats able to work, like infinite slot machine and stuff like that.

If you want everything to turn back to vanilla, you can try reverting all the changes you made manually, or start a new character. I'm not entirely sure if there is another way.

StardewValleyExpanded,"Never used the mod, but taking a look at its files, it seems she doesn't.  She only leaves the house once per week, and that's to visit Emily. If you want her to work at her shop, you'll have to edit her schedule.

Go to the mod folder, into [CP] Looking for Love\assets\Sandy and open Sandy.json.

Search for 

    ""Target"": ""Characters/schedules/Sandy""

You can type in whatever you want to change her schedule to in the Entries section.  So if you want her to head to work each day except Sunday at 10:00 AM and to head home at 6:00 PM, for example, then put these in before the marriage_Sun line (don't know if they actually *need* to go before, just each file that I checked for reference lists Sunday as the last day):

    ""marriage_Mon"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Tue"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Wed"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Thu"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Fri"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Sat"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",

I think that should work. Just make sure you don't miss the commas.  And change the times to whatever you want them to be. If the mod adds lines for her to say on days she stays at home, you might want to remove a day or two from that list so you can see that dialogue (I didn't look too carefully at what all was added for her.)",korrin-,1686610639.0

Fedora,"> ""Mess up my workflow"" makes no real sense.

Well sorry, I misspoke. What I really meant was using a Firefox dev edition flatpak will prevent me from being able to access local projects, as it blocks access to home directory by default. Of course I can fix this, but my preference for everything is always RPMs first, flatpaks second, especially because I refuse to use flathub.

> COPR packages are 3rd party. If they compile well, Fedora can discuss to make them official. This happened with waydroid.

That's very nice to know that there is a pipeline available like this.

> And yes, avoid when possible. Its an external system repo, system upgrades may fail, they are less secure, may cause dependency errors and they are very insecure compared to just flatpaks.

Maybe she's somehow learned the (wrong) belief that she shouldn't expect to enjoy sex and it's something to give to men rather than something inherently enjoyable for both parties under the right circumstances. I completely disagree that she's trying to manipulate you in some way.  She definitely has some things she needs to work through. Given that sexual attraction is important to you (and most people), I  don't think you should continue the relationship, but maybe out of kindness suggest she looks for someone who she is actually attracted to.",Interestedmillennial,1686618189.0

Je peux accepter une ¬´¬†tourn√©e¬†¬ª mais je prends la deuxi√®me s‚Äôil y en a une. 
Avec mon copain, on a gard√© ce genre de rythme sans se prendre la t√™te : un coup c‚Äôest l‚Äôun qui paye, apr√®s l‚Äôautre, parfois on divise. C‚Äôest rare que l‚Äôun ou l‚Äôautre soit enti√®rement invit√© surtout quand on fait une sortie ch√®re (on chipote pas pour un verre ou un kebab quoi). Bien s√ªr c‚Äôest diff√©rent pour les anniversaires ou c√©l√©bration
Je trouve que √ßa permet d‚Äô√™tre plus en phase avec la personne car on se met sur un pied d‚Äô√©galit√©, il n‚Äôy a pas d‚Äôattente vis √† vis de l‚Äôautre par rapport √† √ßa. On choisit tous les deux quelque chose qui convient √† nos budgets respectifs et il n‚Äôy a pas de mauvaise surprise
D‚Äôun point de vue ¬´¬†f√©ministe¬†¬ª, je pense que ce genre de galanterie entretien le clich√© d‚Äôune femme sans ressource qui a besoin d‚Äôun homme pour vivre et cela me d√©range. M√™me si j‚Äôentends l‚Äôargument des diff√©rences de salaires ou de t√¢ches m√©nag√®res, qui fait que les femmes sont davantage exploit√©es par le patriarcat et que donc le patriarcat leur doit bien un date gratuit, je pense que c‚Äôest justement l‚Äôinverse qui se produit : accepter que c‚Äôest √† l‚Äôhomme de payer, c‚Äôest accepter les r√¥les conf√©r√©s par le patriarcat de l‚Äôhomme qui entretient la femme.
Si l‚Äô√©galit√© n‚Äôest pas synonyme d‚Äô√©quit√©, le combat n‚Äôest pour moi pas l√†, mais bien au del√† de la simple question du ¬´¬†c‚Äôest √† l‚Äôhomme de r√©gler l‚Äôaddition¬†¬ª. C‚Äôest plus : pourquoi les hommes se sentent oblig√©s d‚Äôinviter les femmes et les femmes d‚Äôaccepter les invitations ? Pourquoi est-ce qu‚Äôon am√®ne plus facilement l‚Äôaddition √† l‚Äôhomme plut√¥t qu‚Äô√† la femme ? Et surtout : cela est-il toujours pertinent de nos jours ?
De mani√®re g√©n√©rale les femmes travaillent. Elles peuvent se payer seules leurs sorties et leurs consommation. Penser que c‚Äôest √† l‚Äôhomme de payer, c‚Äôest accepter une nouvelle soumission de la femme face √† l‚Äôhomme",Inevitable-Piglet469,1686611469.0

A high turnover of people coming and going every 3 months, and event more alarming, management would not notify or give any reasons as to why people left and if there are plans to fill in their roles in the future.

Work-life balance was a phrased that was looked down upon. People were expected to reply to any requests, no matter how minor, within a matter of minutes even on weekends. With all the extra time I had spent on work during nights and weekends actually felt like taking a pay cut for me, instead of having a decent wage.

Colleagues would get questioned or berated for simplest mistakes publicly. Often in group chats with clients present.

On a down low, a preference was given to interviewees who were single/unattached so that quote ‚Äúthey wouldn‚Äôt have any family to date at them from work‚Äù.

A lot of people on there are not professional sellers so it just makes way more sense to reuse packaging instead of investing in new packaging for their miniscule number of orders.

If I read a review like that I'd go to the buyer who rated that way and proactively block them so they couldn't purchase from me, as they would be disappointed. Lol 

And I would definitely not let that type of review stop me from purchasing from you. There's nothing wrong with reusing packages. Besides, it is better for the environment than using new ones every time. 

Most people will at least look at what the bad ratings are saying before they make a judgment call whether to listen to them. You could also, if you want to be proactive yourself about it, put a note in your bio that you got a poor rating due to reusing an amazon package for an order. Just be upfront about it.

Bitwarden,"Were these SUCCESSFUL logins, or were they?merely attempts? Look at the Bitwarden messages carefully. 

If they were just attempts, you are likely being targeted by one or more credential stuffing attacks. Make sure you have a strong master password (five or more words in a randomly generated passphrase). Make sure you have good 2FA (TOTP or FIDO2/WebAuthn). 

And consider updating your vault to have a different email. Many of us have a second email that is used for Bitwarden and little or nothing else‚Äîbut there is still an app on our phone to ping us of alerts like this. 

If otoh these were successful logins,  then hoo-wee, you have your work cut out. First, you need to figure out how it happened, so you don't just end up here again.  One or more of the devices you have accessed your vault from have been compromised. 

You should only use your vault on a device that you fully trust, and it should never be accessible by others. You should have full knowledge and control of the installed apps, no questionable apps or plugins,  yada yada good opsec.

If you can't find the malware on any of your devices,  you will need to do a full system restore,  including reformatting your disk, of every system you have Bitwarden installed.  Otherwise you risk ending up here again. 

After (and ONLY after) you have a clean device, you also need to clean up your vault. You need to change your master password (be sure to write down the new one), and rotate the encryption key. (This is a good time to switch your KDF to Argon2 if you haven't already.)

Next, you will need to change EVERY password in your vault.  Start with the most important ones, but you will need to change them all. Similarly, if you have a TOTP app on the compromised device (Bitwarden Authenticator or anything else for that matter), you need to rotate the TOTP key as well.

audio,">Why is DSP important ? Is it mandatory for good audio ?

Yes and no. The headphone frequency response is not going to be perfect. You can fix some of that with DSP. In that DSP there is for ex. a 10 channel parametric equalizer that can be used to smooth over the biggest peaks. You need seriously expensive headphones to match DSP corrected ""regular"" headphones, and even then.. the expensive headphones will sound even better with proper correction curve.

Unfortunately, those who want DSPs for headphones don't shy away from high prices but there might be something in the professional audio side.. [https://www.thomann.de/gb/presonus\_revelator\_io24.htm](https://www.thomann.de/gb/presonus_revelator_io24.htm)

But of course, you could just buy 40$ USB audio interface and use Equalizer APO... It can process all windows audio, takes 1% of CPU with low latency.. and is free. That is what i use for audio processing, it is installed in every computer, along with LoudMax limiter (evens out level changes, handy for youtube, TV and movies.. no more quiet dialogue and earth shattering explosions..)..

The second part of the quote, ""Soon everything will have forgotten you,"" is a reminder that our time on Earth is limited. We will all eventually die, and when we do, our physical bodies will decompose and our memories will be lost. This may seem like a depressing thought, but it can also be liberating.

As for Ben... I gotta say he doesn't do a lot for me to like him as a character. I side with him being disgusted and off put by Misty's advances, I understand his rejection of the cannibalism the group has resorted to, and I even get why he would want to burn down the cabin with the entire team inside it. But I don't find him compelling. I liked his bond with Natalie, but it was not explored enough for me to really care about the guy.

There would definitely be some international backlash from SJH fans, but for the show to be cancelled? Naw. 

I think RM should take the risk and do it. And introduce a new female member to the cast. There are so many good replacements and many celebrities would die for the opportunity (think Kang Hanna, Lee Dahee, etc... ) This would also revamp the program and entice more viewers. 

I also want to state that I don't hate Jihyo as a person. I recognize she is a kind individual, as we heard about her paying her staff's wages due to agency issues. But that's her persona outside of work. Beyond that, I'm just highly critical of her role in RM.

So its not so much that theyre closed up but their social meter is pretty full id say. Why would you make new friends when you already have plans every weekend, easter, midsommar etc. Add to that the occasional birthday. It gets trickier and trickier as people grow older. BUT because of this the internationals really do stick together. Ive been living in scandinavia for 7 years and none of my close friends are scandi of any sort. I used to think it was a problem and was truly torn about it. But after learning the language, marrying a scandi and paying taxes for all these years i feel like ive done enough to integrate. my friends will forever be expats and thats ok.",forgetitok,1686611651.0

macbook,"Copy & pasted comment from someone else who just asked me this today:

&#x200B;

A quick google search says macbooks last on average 7 years.  
My dad & a friend of mine both have early 2015 macbook pro's though that they both got in 2015 and they have never had one issue with them at all...ever. So theirs have lasted 8 years so far with not one issue ever, and they're both still kickin and working flawlessly.  
My dad has 100K in his bank account and refuses to upgrade his 2015 macbook even though I keep trying to get him to do it. But even his 2015 is perfectly fine for web browsing, basic tasks and paying bills and that's all he does on it, so it still works great for basic stuff.  
When to upgrade really depends on your budget and what you want out of your laptop. So long story short, if you get a macbook it will almost certainly last you a very very very long time. Probably somewhere in the range of 6 to 8 years (or more) easy if you take care of it.  
And you only need to upgrade it if you have the budget to and/or if you want whatever added little features new macbooks may end up coming with. If not, many many people just ride it out with old macbooks. Old macboks are the old honda civics of the computer world. They last forever, they usually have 0 issues if you take care of them and they're reliable af.  
I bought an M1 14 Pro last month and I have no idea how long this thing will last me, probably a very very long time because this thing is super mega overkill for what I do on my laptop. So I'm expecting to get minimum 4 to 5 years out of it very easily, and that's over top of the fact that it's already a 2 year old laptop. And that's also even being someone who wants a top of the line laptop at all times. But this thing will probably be top of the line for that long, as far as a basic tasks laptop goes.",SimplyHobbit,1686622953.0

mariokart,"I'm still a big fan of Wii U Rainbow Road, but for me it was just a bit underwhelming. The new mechanic of anti gravity completely revolutionized how courses are designed. For example, Bowser's Castle has you driving all over the walls, on the ceiling across from other racers on a different path, and the giant lava Bowser punching the course looked INCREDIBLE. Easily the best Bowser's Castle of all time. So many other courses utilize anti gravity to create incredible paths and designs that interact with the world around you, like Mario Kart Stadium, Water Park, Mario Circuit, Shy Guy Falls, Electrodrome, Dragon Driftway, Big Blue, and even N64 Rainbow Road. Rainbow Road on the other hand barely uses the anti gravity in a way that affects the course, and it's almost like I wanted the course to have the most anti gravity antics and to be incredibly difficult, but it just isn't.

I will also say that \[even though this wasn't around in 2014\], the way courses are designed in the booster course pass, specifically with courses having drastically altered paths between each lap (besides just Mount Wario, N64 Rainbow Road, and Big Blue), it feels like they could have done so much more. Just imagine a course with a crazy path like Sydney Sprint or Singapore Speedway, combined with a course with some ridiculous anti gravity shenanigans like Dragon Driftway, and then make it a Rainbow Road course and amp the difficulty up to 11.

They *don't* choose to.  They require intelligent, sapient brains for both reproduction and nourishment.  They closest they've come to breaking that is in Spelljammer, where they've selectively bred a race with an incredible *potential* for Intellect but no ability to use it (i.e, lobotomised gnomes), which they keep like cattle so as not to have to eat the brains of the races they trade with.

MHRise,"I love that Capcom has listened to virtually everything the community asked for throughout Rise's lifespan. It feels like we built the game along with them! That said.... the difficulty spike in Rise:Sunbreak has made it evident to me that there is such thing as listening TOO MUCH to the playerbase. TU3 is where I feel things started getting ridiculous.

Now, I see myself as a fine enough and competent huntress. There's not a single monster that I can't take on by myself. HOWEVER, there are numerous times in these late update hunts where I have to play at my A-Game, lest I triple cart. Now, I dont have an issue with hunts being hard.....

What I DO have an issue with is when I'm frustrated by these monsters and people like Elitists, Meta Slaves or Masochists STILL say ""hurr durr, still too easy!"" Don't get me started on the people who complain are also the ones that triple cart and make me facepalm saying ""Still think it's too easy?""

Like, at what point do you consider something difficult?! Do you want the game to be IMPOSSIBLE?! Do you always want to be near the point where you commit property damage via Controller Boomerang?!

....Im just gonna say it. I find World:IB easier. The only monster I know I cant beat alone (YET) is Fatalis. Whenever I return from a hiatus from the game, I fire up Raging Brachydios. He never carts me. He is, as I boast, my b*tch. And I play Dual Blades, a weapon I've been told is a bad matchup against Raging Brachydios.

I dont have this same mentality in R:SB. Despite my proficiency with my weapon, increased mobility and power of Wirebugs, one wrong move and that could be a cart.

I love Rise:Sunbreak. Its my favorite game, period. But I have a negative opinion towards all the players who did, AND STILL say the game is too easy. Because I just understand what they consider ""difficult...""",RukiaShikon,1686625075.0

 All that is to say that at some point something went wrong with the Chiefs mess and it's now rearing its ugly head after years of being below the surface. 

I'm not going to drone on about the Fraternity-like mindset of the Mess but will instead point out that Chiefs have lost the drive to do right by their Sailors. They have done this because they have been trained to be risk adverse, with respect to how their actions will affect their career. That thinking has led them to become the Front Line Enforcers, not FL Managers/Mentors. 

That young Sailor sounds like a person who has been made to respect Chiefs out of fear. I see it at my own command and it's similar to the signs of domestic abuse (which I unfortunately have too much personal experience with).

""Sometimes, it can happen like that. Yeah, conditions in England are a lot different to what Indian cricket has been playing in. Sometimes that happens that way, it's called that bit of dressing room pressure,'' said McGrath.

''Both teams haven't played a lot of Test cricket lately but that's the way it goes.

whatsthisrock,"This is coarse-grained fayalitic slag.  Stony meteorites are mostly finely granular chondrites that look nothing like this, and iron meteorites are usually solid Fe-Ni, with some inclusions.  This website has a decent collection of of photos showing fresh and weathered meteorites of different types.  

https://meteoritegallery.com/what-do-meteorites-look-like/

There's nothing remotely like the funky ~honeycomb visible on your piece here - I'm not sure how it formed, but it doesn't resemble any features on known meteorites.  

This looks to be a melted mixture of silicates and metal that was poured out and allowed to cool as a sheet.  That's why you have distinct top and bottom textures and then smoother broken sides.

Police is gonna ask you to come to 3 marriage counseling and after that case will be registered. Once case is registered, she's gonna tell how much you are demanding for dowry and how much is it gonna settle. You'd need a good lawyer to settle things and bargain the settlement. Whatever they demand, start with 10% of it and say that's your limit. You're gonna probably pay 50-60% of what she asks. Lawyer is gonna eat some commision so be prepared for all these.

Let‚Äôs say you have an expense of $1,000. You can write that off, but all it does is save you the *tax*. So if your marginal tax rate is 25%, then it saves you $250 ($1,000 x 25%). However, it‚Äôs still better to not have an expense at all because the total money out of your pocket will still be $750 ($1,000 for the expense minus the $250 you saved with the offsetting tax due).

Would you rather pay $1,000 to save $250 at the end of the year or pay $0 right now and save $0 at the end of the year? Obviously pay $0 and save $0. Nobody should ever pay $1,000 to save $250 since it‚Äôs a net loss of $750.",Savior89,1686629888.0

CompanyOfHeroes,"Yeah snipers are fucking cancer. I've played so many games where I'll just outplay the shit out of someone all game, and then without fail theyll just start spamming snipers, and by the time I start doing the same I'm already two or three snipers behind and it's basically just game at that point because tiny axis squads are particularly weak to it. Countersniping is basically impossible until theyve already wiped half your army because because they recloak faster than you can countersnipe them until their like their third or fourth snipe, and all this time youre not even able to use your sniper against their infantry because if you reveal it you wont get a chance to countersnipe at all, AND there's a not insignificant chance your countersnipe will miss if you actually manage to get a shot off.

Anyone telling you bikes, jeeps, etc are the counter to them is just a shit player. Those units are worthless for chasing down snipers beyond the first 5 minutes. Snipers are gamebreaking, there is no viable way to deal with them beyond having your own snipers. Literally the only time sniper spam isnt the mark of a shit player is for dealing with brits, or countering other snipers.



One thing I REALLY liked about coh3 was how they gimped snipers to basically not scale at all with numbers. If you make a blob of snipers and A move across the map theyll constantly do ineffective things like all fire at the same target. If I woke up a billionaire one day and could go and buy relic, the first thing I'd do as lead of making a coh1 remake would be to implement that. Then make them do half damage to elite armor units, and make their accuracy affected by cover too for good measure.",Horror-Swan5132,1686625050.0

 A good trick for oddly angled situations is if you have a plane at an arbitrary angle, and you want to align an object to it, you can select the object in question, then shift select the plane, go to modify > match transformations > match rotation, this will (unless you've frozen transforms or something) align it to the rotation of that plane. Now if you switch your translate tool to object space you can now translate it in relation to the plane (technically to the local space of the object but since we matched transforms those are effectively identical)

Another thing you can do, and this helps when animating rigs with wonky orientations is to hit d, then rotate the pivot the where its oriented how you like, then go to modify > bake pivots. This gives you the benefit of fixing orientation problems in the middle of animating and it should fix your curves on the graph editor to match.

You can also set the pivot to match any edge on any object by going into the tool settings panel (with one of the transform tools, trans rot or scale, active) and hitting edit pivot and selecting an edge.

Why do you have to ask this???? It's too freaking hard to answer it.

To be honest, the one that i love the most, whatever is a BL or not is still Utsukushii Kare. This series changed me for better. As crazy as it sounds it had a big influence in my life.

It's really hard to chose only one of them because i have my favorite from each genre, whatever is BL or not.

From fantasy/ survival kind of setting, i love Alice in Borderland, Kingdom, Rurouni  Kenshin, The end of the world with me, Assassination classroom, Tokyo Ghoul etc

From the light shoujo or shounen ai adaptations, i loved Heroine disqualified, The black devil and the white prince, Daytime shooting star, Kieta Hatsukoi etc.

From the crime genre, i loved  the Cold case series, Unnatural, and many others. The day Japan will make a BL set in the  crime/mystery setting i will go overboard hahhahaü§£üòÇ. This is my favorite genre among all the other genres in general.

My latest favorite from the non- BL series is Silent",smittenkittyyan,1686631143.0

Keep in mind that their income may not have gone up that much.

stupidpol,"As far as I understand it through historical literature, the claim that Queen Charlotte was black is very recent - I believe it originated in 1920s Germany, was explored further by West Indian historians in the 1940s (Jamaican author Joel Augustus Rogers made that conclusion), and then was expounded *further* by the historian Mario de Valdes y Cocom in... 1997 or 1998? I forget. But it was from there that it has sprung up to become something that people state with almost certainty.

As far as I understand the scholarship, however, the purported ancestor of Queen Charlotte that her being black would stem from was named [Margarita de Castro e Sousa, herself being descended from a woman named Madragana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Margarita_de_Castro_e_Souza_genealogy_and_descent.JPG) who was a mistress of King Alfonso III of Portugal. The assertion that this ancestor was black comes from a misunderstanding regarding the terminology behind what she *was.* It is likely that Madragana was not of sub-Saharan African descent, but was either Moorish (who were themselves predominantly Berber - remember that in the Middle Ages, to call someone 'black' was not inherently racial, but was an assigned term of morality or purity - even white Europeans, such as pagan Lithuanians, could be 'black') or Mozarab (Latin Christians under Islamic rule). It's difficult to know which she was, and although it's not impossible that perhaps Madragana was of sub-Saharan ancestry, it's not necessarily *likely*.

Even if she *did* have an ancestor of sub-Saharan ethnicity or race... It would not be likely to show up *that* far down the line - five centuries after the period in which Madragana lived!

All of this illustrates a greater problem with how identity politics and racial aesthetics are examined by the general public, more susceptible to pop history than to academic history (which is a problem with the academy and with how popular history is conveyed, too - different discussion entirely). There exists a willingness to latch on to something after the fact and retroactively change historical perception to fit a particular sociocultural narrative and the desire to do *something*, but not do so much as to change their own comfort or effect real material change. Historical fantasy allows an outlet to create or rewrite characters in alternate histories and create a retroactive narrative of progressivism without reflecting on present material reality. Portraying a quantity of the upper classes of Great Britain as black in the 18th century doesn't better the on-the-ground realuty for Black Britons or African Americans, but it gives the illusion of a vision of progress which did not exist then, but which they can feel good about portraying now as it portrays a pure meritocracy - it is pandering to some degree and there is a distinct target audience.

As a historian, portrayals such as *Bridgerton* don't *inherently* bother me for their substance as I recognise them for what they are (controversial portrayals such as Cleopatra being sub-Saharan African bother me more for different reasons), but I find myself wanting to or having to explain - when asked - the truthful history to those people I know who are fans of such works more often than not, and I wish more effort was taken to preserve historical accuracy and tell interesting historical stories with characters of all ethnicities and races.",Polskers,1686632001.0

The rear brake service seems odd; unless they're actually worn out, why would they change them? The fronts will go before the rears, so unless you've had the front brakes done, brake hard a lot or live on a mountain, the rears should last for quite a while still. Unless the pads are worn out, smells like bullshit. 

Fuel injection service should not be needed unless there is an actual issue. I have a 17 year old volvo that I recently had to pull the injectors out of. They were in perfect condition at 140k miles. 

The CVT service looks fishy. They're not stating that they're changing the fluid anywhere, just ""performing service"". I cannot find any information about a need for fluid conditioner (no idea why it would need it or what it even is). Yes, you should at one point change the CVT fluid, but it shows as part of Service D which is done at 5 years or 60k miles. Same with diff oil, done during service D.

OnlyFansReviews,"Your request post has joined the moderating queue and will be evaluated for manual approval by mods. If your post does not get approved within the next 24 hours it is because it has not followed the request post guideline. You can read the guideline below, if you feel your post does not follow our guideline please delete it and repost. 

Request posts are for finding a specific ONLYFANS page and creator to SUBSCRIBE to. You can use request posts to find an onlyfans page that that offers specific content and aesthetics, genres and themes you are looking for.  

For example:  
*'I am looking for a busty  creator over 35 y/o who creates 'hot wife' content.'*  
*'I am looking for a creator with a nerdy aesthetic who uses bad dragon toys.'*  

The body of posts should go into more detail. You can include things such as budget, what kind of video content you would like available on their page or tip-able services and deal breakers.  

Requests are NOT for recruiting any nsfw creator/ seller to give you GFE, video call, sexting, someone nice to be your friend, someone to make a custom for you. This negates the point of making a request when you consider that nearly every onlyfans creator offers these services as tip-able extras on their page. Your request should primarily reference the on the feed content a creator is making or a creator with a specific look and style.  

Things you absolutely cannot request:  
- Someone just to chat to.  
- A new or 'small' creator.  
- Custom content/ sexting/ video calls. You may specify that you would like the onlyfans creator/ page you are requesting to have that as an option, but it shouldn't be the basis of your request.  
- Freebies of any kind including dms before subscribing, free content or previews that aren't already readily available on the creator's social media.  
- Taboo content, things that are against onlyfans guidelines. 
- Nothing that could compromise the creators safety or privacy should be requested.  
- Payment methods outside of onlyfans.  
- Budget that goes outside the [pricing guideline](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyFansReviews/comments/ukpora/pricing_guideline/). 

Example of requests that will be removed and poster banned:  
*'Looking for a small creator for girlfriend experience.'*  
*'Looking for a young creator to make a custom.'*

koreanvariety,"Ep 16 is the latest that is out on Netflix, but Netflix is about 4 eps behind Korea broadcast. Seems like OP is talking about Ep 16 but there are some typos and inaccuracies in what OP that feels odd.

- What OP specifically wrote was ""esp 16"", could be a typo of 'Eps 16' or could be referring to 16 starting lineup?

- Based on Ep 16, Lee Jang Gun, Lee Hyung Taik and Kim Jun Hyeon are out. But OP wrote Jun Hyeon twice and included Mo Tae Bum. OP also wrote that 2 previous captains are out. Only Hyung Taik who is a previous captain that is out. IIRC, Jang Gun and Tae Bum temporarily took over the captain's armband when the actual captain at that time was not on the field or if they subbed for the captain. But that doesn't make them count as ""previous captains"".

So I am not too sure if OP is specifically talking about Ep 16.

Anyway, back on your question on Jang Gun.

I believe the coaches are right about Jang Gun but more specifically when they say that he did not practice, they were saying that he did not practice to improve on his weak points. He is weak in ball-trapping and dribbling.

He could only have few self-practice per week (maybe 1 time per week) and in his practice, he could have drilled other stuff like shooting, crossing, long passes, etc. He probably spent little to no time on trapping and dribbling.

Techniques, especially trapping and dribbling can be improved tremendulously with practice before hitting the ""lack of talent"" wall. Kang Chilku and Lee Jihwan are  good examples. They had no experience with soccer prior to joining and you can see how much their ball control skills improved. So Jang Gun definitely did not practice on his weakness. If anything, Jang Gun has better athletism and physicality than Chilku and Jihwan. He is bigger, faster and stronger than them.

Another thing about Jang Gun is that he is a lazy player on the field. He only stays in his tiny area. He doesn't make runs, he doesn't create space, he has terrible vision on the field, he doesn't position himself well. Whereas Eun Gyu and Nam Kyu are constantly making space and drawing defenders out of position. They are as dangerous off the ball as they are on the ball. Game sense generally builds up slowly from playing games. Jang Gun's lack of game sense showed that he doesn't have enough practice games outside of filming the show.

The last thing is his mentality. When he loses the ball, he just lowers his head and sigh in frustration while standing still. Comparing to Chilku and Jihwan again, when they loses the ball, they immediately start chasing after it and start hounding the opponent. This is why they nicknamed Chilku the vacuum.

IMO Jang Gun completely deserves to be dropped from the 1st team.

Sidenote, does Jang Gun not play Kabbadi in the Indian league anymore? Life is back to normal in Korea and India in term of Covid restrictions, doesn't he need to go back to India for his main job?",shiningject,1686625912.0

The reason we have ""primal fears"" is because people who feared those things survived to breed, so it is ultimately an extension of the fear of death
2. I thought you were being metaphorical
3. Death is any life being lost, that being yours or others
4. one, just because those are the ones we are born with doesn't mean they're the root, those are just the first ones we have, and 2, why, pray tell, do we fear those things? Because people who avoided those things got to live long enough to breed
5. glad we agree.
6.  The first human didn't necessarily have it, you cannot prove that. It's possible whenever the first ""human"" (which really would of been a part of another species that had just crossed the line to become a ""human"", wherever you draw that line) had that fear, but it's also possible the conditions the first humans were in didn't result in them developing that fear.

Necrontyr,"I see this criticism come up a lot, and I can empathise - while the crusade following the Akrops into the ghostwind was always my intention, I decided to leave the mechanism by which this occurs deliberately opaque. It was a decision I made carefully, and I stand by it, but I can certainly see where it has left people confused!

I'm loathe to set any explanation in stone, since TDK is very much a story about subjectivity, and I want to leave people free to draw their own conclusions. With that said:

>!The Warlock did it. Or at least, the Warlock allowed it. !<

Am-heht is a being of terrifying power, and also an utter bastard, with their own hidden agenda regarding Oltyx, Mentep, and the entire matter of the Curse. Am-heht knew about the gold and the bones and such - they knew Oltyx would end up drawing his foes to him, and with their mastery of the ghostwind, it would have been no effort at all to simply ""leave the door open"" for the crusade after the Akrops went through. 

I've included three paragraphs from TDK: Reign below, which back up what I said about Am-heht - maybe that will help show where I was coming from. 

Like I say, I don't want to be too prescriptive. But ultimately, an author only gets one chance to tell a story, and if I left people scratching their heads then maybe I could have been clearer! 

At the end of the day, I really appreciate any criticism - it makes me better at what I do, after all, and it means people are reading my work, for which I'm damned grateful :) 

`This‚Ä¶ ghostwind,‚Äô Oltyx interrupted. ‚ÄòIs it some manner of drive? Or a`   
`place?‚Äô`  
`‚ÄòIt is both, and it is neither,‚Äô snapped Am-heht, with idle contempt. ‚ÄòYou`   
`could not understand its true nature. All you need know is this ‚Äì it will`   
`bring you to the circumstance of your testing.‚Äô`  


`---`

  
`‚ÄòI see,‚Äô said Oltyx, who did not see, and then set the butt of his glaive in`   
`the crust beside him with grim resolve. ‚ÄòIn which case, what is to be the`   
`price?‚Äô He considered Shabb once more, hunched in invisible agony at the`   
`edge of his visual field.`   
 `‚ÄòIt is of no cost to me, to return the knowledge of the ghostwind to`   
`Mentep. I have moved beyond such trinkets, now. So, I shall exact no price.`   
`Indeed, to impart this thing on my former disciple‚Ä¶ appeals to me. Perhaps the journey along the path it opens may be what revives the spirit of`   
`Mentep the Inscrutable. Perhaps, even, it will draw him to the resumption`   
`of his great works.‚Äô`  
`‚ÄòSo then, warlock,‚Äô said Oltyx, ‚Äòimpart it.‚Äô` 

`---`

  
`‚ÄòIt is done,‚Äô Am-heht pronounced. ‚ÄòAnd no, I will demand nothing from`   
`you in return, little king. Because this gift is for Mentep, in the end. But`   
`make no mistake, Oltyx of Ithakas ‚Äì whatever benefit you may derive from`   
`it, you will pay for in due time.‚Äô`  
`Oltyx stood dumbstruck on the slag, unsure whether he had just secured`   
`a great victory against all expectations, or sealed himself to a terrible fate.`   
`Perhaps both, and neither, he decided, eventually. He had no idea what had`   
`just happened. There were so many questions, and so few he dared to ask.`   
`But there were practical matters, at least, that he could not neglect.`  
`‚ÄòWill our pursuers be able to follow us, as we make use of this ghostwind?‚Äô`  
`‚ÄòNot if you do not will it to be so,‚Äô said the warlock, as if the answer should`   
`have been obvious. Oltyx did not feel in any way reassured, but refused to`   
`stumble over the cryptic answer.`",Nate_Crowley,1686633994.0

TrueAnon,"I should clarify that I'm in academia and most strikes are not centered around research workers but are instead focused on withholding grades and stopping various administrative tasks (hiring people, etc.). The actual ""rigorous and expensive labor"" still usually ends up being done, as we never seem to be able to scare grad students and postdocs away from maintaining lab work (they complain that they'll lose 2+ years of work, etc.). You don't really sound like you have a clear picture of how these things work. In particular, you don't seem to understand what I'm talking about with regards to ""the problems for the undergrads"".

Sorry, maybe I should have clarified that I'd love to have someone with experience doing labor organizing in this industry to chime in, as I don't ever really get to ask about the end goals of the labor initiatives I've been involved with in the past and they have ranged from terrible (some of the wrecker stuff mentioned elsewhere in here) to aimless (we withhold grades and stop responding to emails from the undergrads for another ? weeks and then ? will cause the administration to do what we want).

AskScienceDiscussion,">NASA is planning to build a permanent base on the moon.

With supplies from Earth and a regular rotation of personnel. It's also a hell of a long way off in the future.

>surely the hard vacuum of space, with temperatures fluctuating between 120C \~ -208C and fine, abrasive glass needles for dirt is a far more hostile environment than an asteroid could ever render the earth without turning the crust into magma right?

After a certain point, it is irrelevant to compare ""more hostile"". Once you reach a point where life is no longer supportable, you're really just quibbling. It's like arguing which is more deadly, Venus or Jupiter. You're dead within seconds either way so what does it matter?

To get back to your question, there are multiple ways an asteroid can render the Earth inhospitable without turning the crust to magma. All it has to do is trigger the right set of circumstances. In fact, it doesn't even take an asteroid. Several mass extinctions, including one that almost wiped us out not too long ago, happened as a result of events that happened on Earth itself.

>surely the threat of total planetwide extinction would warrant significantly higher budgets than scientific curiosity right?

And surely if you threw 9 women at pregnancy you could have a baby in a month, right?

If a K-T-type asteroid were heading for the planet, you could throw all the money in the world at it and there'd be no way to prevent it. And good luck trying to build shelters when the fundamental fabric of society breaks down in the absolute panic it would cause.

>surely it'll be much easier to construct things on the surface of the earth, where materials and equipment can rely on a worldwide network of trade and transport infrastructure that's existed since the very first cities, than it would be to fire them to the moon using enough fuel to accelerate it to mach 33.7 right?

You're missing the point. We don't have long-term self-sustaining shelters from something like a K-T asteroid. You're talking hundreds if not thousands of years depending on how things shake out. That's not a simple ""moon base"" type structure, nor could they be built on the scale to save billions of people.

And that would lead to panic and chaos. Governments would try to keep such a discovery quiet for as long as possible, but it wouldn't last long, especially in this day and age.

>this is the reason that i am of the opinion that a cataclysm needs to either be powerful enough to turn the earth into an asteroid belt, be without warning, or violate the laws of physics as we know it to render mankind extinct.

About 70,000 years ago humanity almost shuffled off this mortal coil due to drastic sudden climate change. You have FAR too much faith in our technology to sustain ourselves in anything but the climate we've been living in for the past few thousand years.

For example, the arable land that is capable of supporting the mass agricultural operations that feed the world makes up a very small percentage of the Earth's surface. A slight shift in the dominant climate patterns and all those arable lands become dust bowls.

Every society is three meals away from chaos.",Xyrus2000,1686543441.0

SBSE General Field Exam RA is very stressful and frankly the worst division in the IRS. There's a reason why there is so much turnover.

If you really want to stick to auditing, go with DCAA. Much better room for growth.

What each weapon brings and therefore what/how to counter that weapon is important. In basic terms, using a weapon with range against something like a short sword means not allowing opponents close that gap. That means knowing how to use footwork.

careerguidance,"You cannot lose money by making more money. That part is straightforward.

The higher tax rate is just barely complex enough to screw some people up a bit, but it really isn't complicated. For simplicity's sake, lets use fake numbers. Say you're in a 10% bracket but get bumped up to a 25% bracket when your paycheck hits $2000. At $2000 you pay $200 in tax. How much do you pay if you make $2100? $225. That's 10% of $2000 plus 25% of the last $100. Only the part that's above the cutoff gets taxed at the higher rate. 

Some folks just can't stand to pay their taxes. And it's true, when you see a bigger bite taken out it does kinda discourage overtime a bit. But you're damn sure not losing money doing it.

webhosting,"There is nothing to configure in your router.
Nginx receives requests for both domain names and then answers them using the site that matches from the configs server blocks.

If they are both hosted on the same machine then you don't need anything apart from a separate server bloc for each site. It's better to split the server blocks into their own config file.

This guide will get you going (one of the first results when searching).
https://tonyteaches.tech/nginx-multiple-sites/

The office docs are also helpful
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html

If the sites are on separate machines then you need one of them to proxy to the second (or a third machine to proxy to both). Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy with proxy_pass

You will also want each site to write error and access logs to their own files (as well as the master nginx logs), so you can see which messages are for which site easily.

You can also setup a default config to refuse a connection if someone tries to access via the IP address rather than a domain name

The series is impenetrable if you either don't have a legion of fans informing you the best way to go about X and Z or you ""get it"" from the start and it sinks its teeth into you. We have seen this literally in real time with the announcement of VI, how many influences have cried and cried until they saw X or Y video and ""discovered"" the tricks to Armored Core and now they get the fun.

AccidentalAlly,"Okay, so, my assumptions come from the fact that they say it's embedded in their religion to hate us.  Obviously it isn't EVERY Christian, but when it's every single one you talk to, with the exception of maybe one every month on average, you start to get an idea of how people probably feel about the person you are.  When every person you talk to of that religion, again, with the exception of once a month on average, says that trans people are grooming babies and then use their God to defend it, you start to get the idea that maybe the majority of people following the religion are just super hateful people.

However, you don't see trans people doing the things that they claim.  Drag Queens don't do the things they claim.  Gay people don't do the things they claim.  They just lie.  But when so many people share the experience of having religion be the justification for hating us on a legal level, you should sorta try to understand where people like me are coming from rather than licking the Christian boot and trying to appeal to them.  If you critically analyze what I said you might be able to deduce ""oh, this person has likely only had negative experiences with people of faith, with the way they talk about this.""

Why should I go high when they won't?

Oh, almost forgot; in America and most of the western world, Christianity dominates.  The majority of people one way or another believe in the Christian God.  At least, more people than their are gay people, or trans people.  With queer people being in the minority of people, and Christianity being the largest religion in the entire world, one generalization is more dangerous than the other.  The generalization of queer people being child groomers is FAR more harmful.  It has pushed anti-queer legislation in the United States.  It's the reason so many children are being denied hormone blockers, which are completely reversible.

Strange, isn't it, how saying that Christians are hateful doesn't introduce laws that make it so they can't practice their faith.  It doesn't make lawmakers outlaw their religion because i said ""on average they're miserable hateful people"".  It's almost like they're a protected group legally who use their legal protections to exert pressure on other groups with much LESS legal protections!

It's almost like that.",PLAGUE8163,1686637472.0

Dentistry,"Going to add my two cents on this one:

Yes, there is additional duplicated cost with multiple offices and yes, you may profit more from one well run practice vs two and decrease headaches. But‚Ä¶ you may also make much more in both practices vs one as well.

I have two offices and I can assure you, the addition of my second practice 3 years ago catapulted my income where my one private practice would not have allowed due to size. There is a certain great feeling knowing that while I am working at one office, another is making money for me. 

Is it stressful? Sure. Would I consolidate down to one practice? Maybe in the future, but not now.

It all depends on what you want out of your career.
Your 37 years of successful private practice sounds commendable and kuddos to you for it. Success is subjective however. So much goes into that like annual earnings, job satisfaction, patient outcomes, etc.

Speaking for myself, my reason for the multi practice approach was to eventually ease off the pedal and create something larger than myself. This will involve associates‚Ä¶ that is okay.

im using the ""vfio-pci.ids=**"" kernel parameter to load vfio stubs to the 1080, how ever I loose the ttys.

midnightsuns,"I cannot disagree more.

>!Sara thought she had her life all figured out. Be an immortal Blood, keep Chthon from infiltrating this world, hang out with your sister and fight demons. Pretty sweet gig.!<

>!But then it all started to go wrong.!<

>!First, the Salem coven reported a rising threat in the New World. We can assume that, despite their exceptional powers, Sara and Lilith were not omnipotent. They may not have known about the New World, or knew much about it. They did what seemed reasonable: have a moon seal to the coven to look after themselves. It didn‚Äôt work.!<

>!They don‚Äôt indicate how hard it was to move the Abbey from Transia to Massachusetts, but the implication is that it was difficult and extraordinary. Hiram Shaw was enough of danger to justify the move. He was so awful, so violent, so close to Chthon that Lilith tortured him to death.!<

>!And this is after she fell in love with a mortal! For two immortal sisters, it seems to have been as exceptional as the moving of the Abbey. This all must‚Äôve felt like too much for Sara. Once the plague came, took Gregor, and threatened Lilith‚Äôs baby, her betrayal must have felt like an eventuality. Somehow, after thousands of years Chthon had succeeded in turning her very own sister, a Blood!!<

>!But then Agatha appeared. Sara came to understand the sort of love that Lilith had experienced. Hunter may have been Sara‚Äôs last, best hope at thwarting Lilith and Chthon, but Agatha reminded her that she had become a caretaker. She was more than just an immortal Blood, she was an aunt and a life-partner. She had loved ones worth fighting for ‚Äî and dying for.!<

>!It worked, sort of. She did stop Lilith and Chthon, but it cost the life of the Hunter. In a sense, Sara failed as a caretaker, but that‚Äôs why we first meet her tending the flowers at Hunter‚Äôs resting place. Perhaps she could be a caretaker of Hunter in the afterlife.!<

>!Some years later, after reforming the Midnight Suns and fending off occasional problems, the unthinkable happened. The Scarlet Witch blew up Agatha, apparently trying to access the Elder Gods‚Äô temples or whatever. Maybe Agatha had egged her on, but the result was entirely Wanda‚Äôs fault. She lost control ‚Äî just as Sara and Agatha had feared would happen with Hunter so many years ago. Sending Wanda off to intern with the Sorcerer Supreme was an immense kindness to the girl who reckless got Agatha killed. The one person who made Sara better, softer, more open-hearted was dead.!<

>!To have Dr. Strange portal in one day, having failed to get the cooperation of Johnny Blaze, blathering on about Lilith, insisting that they reanimate the Hunter ‚Äî it all must‚Äôve been too much for Sara to handle. Sure, she‚Äôs an asshole. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong, and a gaggle of Avengers were intruding on her Abbey insisting that they needed the Hunter back. Fine. Reanimate them, get your Sanctum back, stop whatever bullshit Lilith has planned.!<

>!Except Lilith‚Äôs got a symbiote now that‚Äôs sort of immune to magic. And a couple of murderous goons with impressive skill sets. And eventually she snags the one man who knows how to use the one piece of technology capable of forging the only champion who can withstand the reforging of the Darkhold.!<

>!(This doesn‚Äôt even touch on Dracula‚Äôs bullshit!)!<

>!Yeah, Sara‚Äôs got some hard edges. She should. She‚Äôs seen some shit, and it seems like she‚Äôs the only one trying to keep this whole clown rodeo on track. Nico and Magik are going rogue. Stark and Strange are fixated on their own losses. Hunter invited fucking *DEADPOOL* to come live with them! But yeah, she‚Äôs the heartless bitch. It goes with the territory.

Reddit intends to begin charging exorbitant fees for API access starting June 19. If this plan is enacted, several third-party apps will be forced to shut down on June 30. They include Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Sync, and Redd Planet, among others. Third-party apps allow Reddit users to control and customize the ways that they view and interact with the platform, and allow Reddit‚Äôs volunteer moderators to perform their duties. 

Reddit‚Äôs decision to cash in on its API comes as the company is preparing to file for an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. Reddit profits from digital advertising, but Reddit has struggled to monetize its user base. 

Although Reddit launched way back in 2005, it didn't release its own app until 2016. For years, users had to rely on third-party apps -- these third-party apps helped Reddit grow its mobile user base. The official Reddit app is suboptimal in a number of ways but the most important are that it does not provide accessibility tools for visually impaired users and has less tools and functionality for moderation. Third-party apps offer their own aesthetic and features which are preferred by many users. 

Many subreddits are protesting in the form of a blackout beginning June 12. 

r/fragrance is suspending moderation, including automoderation, for the protest period. Posts and comments made during this time are unmoderated, as indicated by this comment.

r/fragrance moderators use third-party apps to moderate on mobile devices and understand that many users also prefer these apps. We encourage users to voice their concerns and support for third party apps to Reddit admin.

Saudi-US relation is several decades old. It has been really solid since Kissinger made a petro-dollar deal with Saudi. US provides Saudi with arms, rely on their oil, give support-protection to Saudi. And Saudi sells oil in dollar, support US in their military activities, buys billions of dollars worth US bonds. Arab block supported US during cold war since communists were anti religion. 

With all that said, things went exactly as you said. Democrats prioritized media-election points over US foreign policy. Trump repeatedly tried to keep US-KSA relation stable and ot was stable back then. Trump tried to avoid Khashoggi murder since it will cause problem in US-Saudi relations. 

But Democrats preferred to virtue signal with the murder. Btw, I'm not talking about actual justice, punishment for criminal. In international politics, justice is a fairy tale that no one cares about. Democrats intentionally destroyed the US-Saudi relations. Stopped sending weapons to Saudi. 

And now Saudi is afraid. They don't think of US as the stable ally they once thought them to be. Saudi is considering their relations with China, Russia.

Let‚Äôs put it this way: testing the RWD if you never drove an EV (or more precisely a Tesla) will give you a more natural progression.

In the US, where speed limits are low, superchargers are plentiful, and people cannot drive, the Model 3 RWD is more than ANY driver will ever need.

SPTarkov,"For SPT/EFT, you‚Äôre going to want to upgrade *both.*

That said, I‚Äôd probably upgrade the CPU *first*‚ÄîTarkov likes having a relatively large amount of on-die cache memory on the CPU compared to what you have. When it doesn‚Äôt have enough, the result is frequent frame drops/stuttering (i.e. you will drop from Frames Per Second to Seconds Per Frame, and it‚Äôll happen pretty much any time that bots think‚Äîon spawn, and on aggro).

The difficulty is that you‚Äôre on a first-Gen Ryzen processor, which means that you‚Äôre likely on a first-Gen Ryzen board. That means that the path to updating to a BIOS revision that supports Ryzen 5000 processors (if one even exists for your board) might require you to update the BIOS at least twice, and to use an intermediate CPU (e.g. Ryzen 2000/3000) for the final update (TLDR: AMD made too many AM4 CPUs, and it‚Äôs impossible for any single BIOS to support *all* of them). It‚Äôs also a problem because it‚Äôs not really worth sinking a lot of money into a new CPU for a board that old, given the realities of old boards (boards are a common failure point, and the feature sets of old boards are one of the things that pushes people to upgrade).

Overall, my specific recommendations, ranked from best to worst in terms of performance, are:

* AM5 board + 32GB DDR5 + 7800X3D
* AM5 board + 32GB DDR5 + 7600
* Used B550/X570 board + 32GB RAM + used 5600/5600X/5800X3D (but only if it‚Äôs priced attractively enough)
* Your current board + your current RAM + a used Ryzen 3000/5000 CPU.

#Do not ask for medical advice, and do not play doctor

What constitutes medical advice?
***

* ""What is this?"" 

 This is asking someone to diagnose the issue, and is medical advice.

* ""What should I do?""

This is asking someone to advise treatment, and is medical advice.

 * ""Should I go to the doctor?""

This is asking if you should seek treatment, and ergo, medical advice. 


**If you would ask the question of your doctor, it falls under this rule and not allowed. As a general rule, asking for medical advice from internet strangers is never a good idea. If you have questions regarding your condition, you are advised to contact your healthcare provider. If you are a medical provider, we would gently remind you that users are not patients, and you should not be offering medical advice to people who are not your patients.**

In Hara's Kingdom Zhao attacked first because Qin at this point was busy with their internal succession wars and gaining valuable lands from Han and Wei. EiSei couldn't attack Zhao because even he knew Zhao had nothing to offer for the expenses of such a war. Its historical fact that Qin attacked others based on value not just grudge. So while all others were playing border skirmishes Qin was smashing the golds and taking numbers. 

Even at Chouhei, RenPa understood he was fighting a losing war as Qin had 70 years advance on them, hence why he went for a walled trench war with direct orders to NOT FIGHT QIN on Open battlefield as the later beat them at everything from technological advances to logistics to the economy. His hope was that Qin would get bored waiting and focus on the other more valuable lands and forget about them. But his King was a dumbass and didn't get the message and thats what caused Chouhei, where Zhao lost not only any chance of winning but also their best general who had enough of Zhao stupidity and decided to retire to Wei. 

So had  Hara's RiBoku didn't barge in Qin's plan, Zhao would have ignored at least till either Han and or Wei fell. That's more years they could have used to restock, prepare better defenses or at least attempt to catch up between the power gaps between the 2 nations.

Guess what historical RiBoku's great plan that he is so famous for vs Qin involved? A repeat of RenPa's Wall trenches war with direct orders to not openly fight Qin in the fields? Its the reason why he is historically #4 in the 4 great generals of the era. Haruki is 1, RenPa is 2, OuSen is 3 then RiBoku.

phcareers,"Hi! 

With 5 years of my working experience, 2 years nakawfh till now. Introvert din ako at madalas ayoko din makainteract ng ibang tao. Having onsite experience is great as well pero preferred ko ang wfh.
Why?
1. Hindi ka magcocommute ‚ù§Ô∏è naranasan ko mag commute from rizal to makati for 2 months at yun ang pinaka nakakapagod.
2. You have your time(Not sure if same sa iba). My shift is 6am-3pm, wake up at 5am to time in and then sleep ulit. I can finish my workload for 4 hours and so.
3. Once out, out na. No one will message you after your shift. Sometimes they might pero you can reply the next day naman. 
4. Peaceful (kung trip mo na walang kausap, madalas wala talaga kakausap sayo)
5. For my team, they're the best. My manager and teammates are so responsive, and they will give you assistance, mag reach out ka lang.

The only ones who didn't get forcefully abducted from their own society are the Dwarves and, later on, some PoWs from the Holy Kingdom which, might I remind you, became PoWs and lost everything they had BECAUSE of Nazarick.

In the eyes of a Sorcerous Kingdom resident, he is not a ""benevolent ruler"", he is a god. People avoid him like the fucking plague because IF they offend him, they know they're as good as dead. The people who cannot avoid him always tip-toe around him like he's made of glass for the same exact reason.

PioneerMTG,"Not what you're asking for, but this is my opinion about Yorion in control shell: it's bad ^^ it really mess with the consistency of drawing your lands and/or important card for a given situation. 

Here is an example that illustrates that and made me aknowledge that Yorion isnt good in controlish deck : I'm the kind of kind who can't decide which card to cut when building a deck, because I want to play with all the cards I like, and for that, Yorion is the easy answer. 1 or 2 years ago, I built an Esper Doomforetold (in MTGA Historic), and played with it for almost a month, couldn't get past to diamond. I felt the problem of consistency, too many matches being manascrewed or not finding my key cards. I just tried the same list without Yorion and cutting the less impactful cards and got to Mythic in less than a week...

For me it's the same for UW control. Especially because the meta seems pretty fast (Mono W, the new Boros, Cheesefang, spirits, etc...), and in those matchups, you typically want to get your early removal cards, which will be harder to find in a diluted 80 cards deck. And besides that, I don't think Yorion gives you an edge in the mirror match or against mono G for instance. The only good reason to play it is against rakdos I'd say (which is relevant tho ahaha)

So that's it, sorry for not responding your initial question and for my English, but this was my take on Yorion.",Majjin_,1686644962.0
Skincare_Addiction,"Welcome to r/skincare_addiction! We'd like to take this time to remind you of a few things:

#Do not ask for medical advice, and do not play doctor

What constitutes medical advice?
***

* ""What is this?"" 

 This is asking someone to diagnose the issue, and is medical advice.

* ""What should I do?""

This is asking someone to advise treatment, and is medical advice.

 * ""Should I go to the doctor?""

This is asking if you should seek treatment, and ergo, medical advice. 


**If you would ask the question of your doctor, it falls under this rule and not allowed. As a general rule, asking for medical advice from internet strangers is never a good idea. If you have questions regarding your condition, you are advised to contact your healthcare provider. If you are a medical provider, we would gently remind you that users are not patients, and you should not be offering medical advice to people who are not your patients.**

If you have an Nvidia card and your drivers are up to date, that may be the issue. RDR2 has not updated to catch up to it yet, and you'd need to roll back your Nvidia drivers to a previous version. 

Bear in mind, if you attempt the Vulkan/DirectX 12 switch that it often is not the cause of the problem and DirectX 12 tends to perform a bit worse overall than Vulkan.

Best way to weigh it up to see if it's worth doing:

Apply 20% of the HTB amount for each year out of the 5 years that you wouldn't be in the relevant property. Basically, 2-3 years. If you started the selling process now, chances are you wouldn't finalize everything until early next year. 

Subtract your current mortgage balance from 400K. 
Factor in ‚Ç¨10k for solicitors fees (for the sale, the purchase of your new property, stamp duty etc).
Up to 5k for the estate agent managing the sale of your property and another 1-2k for a survey, valuation report and anything else that might pop up.

None of those are M2M, like a RC. The first is voice, the third is a sensor, not a data transmission method, and I'll be nice and let clappers slide.

You don't have AF air conditioners, nor TVs, nor stereos, nor car fobs, nor fans, nor zigbee, nor weather stations. No devices replace RF or IR communication with AF.

> That style of symbol was associated has been associated with audio for a long time,

Yes, for audio _processing_. The symbol used for ""this device makes noise"" is that symbol preceded by a speaker symbol.

The ""no sound"" symbol is a crossed speaker (sometimes with your symbol), but it is never your symbol alone. This is becsuse it is very easy to confuse with the multidude of similar symbols with ""emanating waves"", like NFC or wifi.

That symbol is also used for RF in general, and waves of any kind, not just audio.

> They still produced sound audible to humans.

As an unintended consequence. You can still see dark red light on remote controls, in a dark room, and you could still hear interference from gsm or particularily strong transmmitrers on amplifiers. That doesn't mean IR remotes use visible light, or GSM uses AF, it's just an unintended consequence.

> it do be wireless tho.  I don't see any wires. Do you?

Sure, I'll concede to the language burn. Obviously things buzzing and beeping to talk to one another is how electronics communicate and what consumers understand by wireless.

Do you blast Beethoven's fifth @ 1000W to unlock your car, or do you use RF? Both are wireless, but nobody really assumes AF modulation means wireless.

CompetitiveWoW,"> I don't understand what healers want from the game. Do they want to just throw some maintanance spell and dps?

Yes, a lot of them seem to want that - minus the DPS part actually. There's a frighteningly large amount of people who want a healer situation like in SL S3, where you could mostly get carried to KSM as a healer by merely keeping up Riptide or Renew or whatever and just throwing out the odd Flash Heal - even the prospect of filling empty globals with DPS seems to be undesirable for that group of players.

For the longest time these players got pretty much free rating for veeeeery little effort - and that changed when we got SL S4 starting to introduce very relevant healer checks all of the sudden (which they then nerfed 10 times over), only to double down on them in DF S1 (which they then nerfed 10 times over), only to then double down on them again in DF S2 (which they mostly have yet to nerf).

Without trying to put anyone down, but most healers in WoW are pretty much equivalent to like silver rating support players in LoL that would actually end up in Bronze if they were to play any other role. They just want to press heal on CD the second someone drops to 95%, but the second someone then drops to 90% everything's just too much.

> It's very rewarding. 

And also giga punishing.

You can easily get by with 1 subpar DPS in your group, but if your healer can't make the healing check on the third boss in Halls of Infusion your key is just bricked. That's a lot of responsibility resting on a single person.

> I hope these healer checks don't go away.

Eh - I'm fine with healer checks in general, the issue I have with them is if 2 dungeons have vastly different healing requirements at the very same key level. Like the Frog guy in Halls of Infusion literally does half as much damage as the Forgemaster in Neltharus - their pulsing AoE damage comes out at the same intervals and hits for the same amount, yet Forgemaster randomly also follows that one up with a debuff on 3 people. Alternatively Magmatusk in Neltharus hitting people with a DoT that ticks for 20% of people's HP that lasts for 25 seconds and you can't do anything about vs Brackenhide's first boss hitting people with a DoT ticking for similar amounts... yet that one can be removed by getting people over 90% HP just once. I don't particularly enjoy healing a +20 Uldaman feeling like healing a +24 Freehold - I'd prefer a +20 Uldaman being as challenging on my healer as a +20 Freehold.",Gasparde,1686646217.0

PMG's one glaring mystification of the studio's work processes‚Äìwhich turned out to be the video's hobby horse‚Äìis that they took for granted that the work was basically chugging along and would've been fine were it not for the absentee/disorganized/asshole Artists.

TrueChristian,"Confess your sin. 

Repent (change course of thinking and doing).  Is this a sin that is reoccurring, or ..? If so, it may take an even more aggressive approach. Reply back and I will go more in response for suggestions.

Now to receive peace, I suggest that you meditate on the scriptures to gain faith and pray & proclaim the promise of scriptures out loud with bold authority. 

The enemy is a liar and wants to keep the children of God oppressed and under torment‚Ä¶. But Christ has come to destroy the works of the devil and to give us an abundance of life. The Kingdom of God is within us! Greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world. The gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church of Jesus Christ. No weapon formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that rises up against you in judgment shall be condemned.

Come on, rise up in prayer and fight the good fight. The enemy has been defeated. You serve a mighty God, one that is rich in mercy. Who sent His Son for you and for me as the perfect sacrifice to buy our freedom and victory!!!! He didn‚Äôt just purchase our salvation (although that would have still been more than what we deserved) but He purchased our healing and freedom. If we are in Christ then there is no more fear of condemnation ! God is for us and not against us. Nothing can separate us from the Love of God. 

Beloved put your hope in God and in His goodness. Believe that He has overcome this world and that He has called you as a son, heir to His Kingdom, more than a conqueror. You can come into His throne room with bold assurance that you shall receive grace and mercy. You have spiritual access to His rich and glorious inheritance. If you are a child of God then you are not a slave to fear. Come and receive your portion in the Lord. Rejoice and give thanks because Christ has paid your debt once and for all, show Him your gratitude and glorify Him!!! 

Often times I find my deliverance comes from praise and worship. As the scripture says it can throw off the enemy‚Äôs camp and send them into a derision. But also because when your mind is stayed steadfast on the Lord you obtain His peace. So stop focusing at the problem and gaze upon the beauty of the Lord. 

Pour out your heart to him, ask for forgiveness for grieving His Spirit. And to blot away all your transgressions and iniquity. Plead His mercy would cleanse your heart and teach you in the way of righteousness. And give thanks for the finished work of Christ Jesus. Praise the Lord for the shedding of the perfect lamb of God has given you forgiveness and redeemed your life from the pit.",Best-Positive5492,1686645695.0

YoneMains,"Idk why but rushing Bork almost always results in me losing tower dude... am I prioritizing the Bork items incorrectly? I buy the recurve bow into the vamp scepter instead of pickaxe for some reason, is that my problem?

If I'm behind I rush galeforce after getting t2 boots of course, and always get a powerspike that completely saves me. Long before I even complete the item, it feels like the zeal and the BF sword are just so much stronger than the equivalent investment into Bork.

I also feel like Bork requires a specific playstyle that I don't fully understand. Especially when it comes to applying the Bork effect onto the first thing you Q and nothing else, etc. Seems like it takes more skill (which I may be lacking) and an adjustment to playstyle that I don't fully comprehend.

sto,"It's 40 points, not 40 days, and you can earn 2 points per day, so it's only 20 days to finish the event.  The event runs for 30 days, so there's plenty of time.

It's not your fault, it's not spelled out in this announcement like it usually is, because... reasons, but the TFOs and Story Mission give 2 points of progress, and the Patrols give 1 point.  So you can do the Patrols if you prefer, but you'll have to do 2 of them to get your full 2 points each day. The ""playstartrekonline"" link above about the Looming Threats event does have the full details, including the end date of July 13th, and more mission and reward info.

Auri might remind Kvothe of his mother (not in appearance per se). He thinks of them both as sweet, loving, and kind people.

OnlyFansReviews,"Your request post has joined the moderating queue and will be evaluated for manual approval by mods. If your post does not get approved within the next 24 hours it is because it has not followed the request post guideline. You can read the guideline below, if you feel your post does not follow our guideline please delete it and repost. 

Request posts are for finding a specific ONLYFANS page and creator to SUBSCRIBE to. You can use request posts to find an onlyfans page that that offers specific content and aesthetics, genres and themes you are looking for.  

For example:  
*'I am looking for a busty  creator over 35 y/o who creates 'hot wife' content.'*  
*'I am looking for a creator with a nerdy aesthetic who uses bad dragon toys.'*  

The body of posts should go into more detail. You can include things such as budget, what kind of video content you would like available on their page or tip-able services and deal breakers.  

Requests are NOT for recruiting any nsfw creator/ seller to give you GFE, video call, sexting, someone nice to be your friend, someone to make a custom for you. This negates the point of making a request when you consider that nearly every onlyfans creator offers these services as tip-able extras on their page. Your request should primarily reference the on the feed content a creator is making or a creator with a specific look and style.  

Things you absolutely cannot request:  
- Someone just to chat to.  
- A new or 'small' creator.  
- Custom content/ sexting/ video calls. You may specify that you would like the onlyfans creator/ page you are requesting to have that as an option, but it shouldn't be the basis of your request.  
- Freebies of any kind including dms before subscribing, free content or previews that aren't already readily available on the creator's social media.  
- Taboo content, things that are against onlyfans guidelines. 
- Nothing that could compromise the creators safety or privacy should be requested.  
- Payment methods outside of onlyfans.  
- Budget that goes outside the [pricing guideline](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyFansReviews/comments/ukpora/pricing_guideline/). 

Example of requests that will be removed and poster banned:  
*'Looking for a small creator for girlfriend experience.'*  
*'Looking for a young creator to make a custom.'*

You don‚Äôt qualify enough leads? The inference being they think your role is just to qualify as many leads as possible. Fill the pipeline with as much shite as you can and failure to do so means you‚Äôre not selling well enough?

Info: what qualification criteria are used by the BDRs?

The BDR manager needs retraining on sales process and qualification. In my view, openly saying to an AE that you‚Äôre de-prioritising their territory to punish them for not qualifying more leads should be disciplinary proceedings for the BDR. A warning at a minimum.

Your manager (probably with you supporting) needs to have a conversation with your sales VP about how the BDR team is functioning. Share what you‚Äôre seeing as the VP may not be aware.

crusaderkings3,"All children have a claim on their parents' titles. Even if daughters usually can't inherit. This is also a good way to increase your territory - invite landless princesses to press their claim on a kingdom.

Do your current character have any children? Daughters preferably? Use them to secure alliances either with strong vassals or outside rulers, that can help you in the coming civil war.

Sway and gift/bribe those of your vassals who aren't completely in the red. Getting just one or two vassals off the faction to install your PC's sister will sometimes/often be enough to make the faction weak enough to not press its claim. This can also be done through marriage-alliance with said vassal.

Finally, in the war, you have the advantage of first strike. Even if your forces and the rebel forces are technically equal, they have to gather theirs first. Once they can press their demand, raise your forces next to one of their capitals and wait. Then wipe out one of the larger rebel armies (can be a bit costly). This way, you will already be ahead in the civil war.

I also prefer not to let my sons marry - or marry as late as possible. Only my heir gets to marry early. This way the line is secure, but my other sons also can't secure alliances through their children. Oh and give your heir a county if you can - it seems to make him more efficient at propagating and gets him an early start of lifestyle choices (can backfire though with him getting killed in a personal war). 

Hope it helps.",42stoics,1686649353.0

LastEpoch,"Yes, exactly my point. Paladin has easy access to the baseline defenses and good block support. VK has a bit harder time getting those but with T20+ gear on the correct bases, BoH and farmed Blessings those become no issue anymore and the block mitigation is similiar as most of the viable Block support is Block Chance. At that point a Ravenous Void comes into the picture as well - VK can wear it without much hinderence to it's dps, Paladin has to sacrifice an entire slot. This is 15% *less damage taken*. VK has more damage due to echoes *and* more leech, so VK also has the higher recovery - which makes the higher health pool matter a lot.

Bogleheads,"> Most of the users here have no idea what this dispute is even about

Half their subscriptions disappearing might help clue them in. Surely you'd agree that most of the mods and primary content contributors know what it's about. You seem to.

The point of going dark was to remind reddit that the (live, human) users, the mods, and the content contributors are their product. That's beyond reasonable that they want customers to pay a premium for advertising space and valuable data, and it would be wonderful if reddit were to turn a profit. But first they need a product.

It's been 20 years now and they still haven't [found us](https://mstdn.social/@davidrevoy@framapiaf.org/110532792812174980) yet.

> (and frankly, the accusation of ""corporate greed"" is no charge at all to total market index fund investors. ""Corporate greed"" is why we get a return on our investment)

The winners and the losers alike are all greedy; that doesn't make losing a winning proposition. Our gains come from the winners. The winners are the ones with great products, formidable moats, excellent managers and fortress balance sheets. This dump has had a billion dollars dumped into it and they can't figure out how to show ads to people without starting a conniption.

Do you really want that hot mess weighing down your passive investments? I certainly don't.

FWIW I don't really care whether this sub went dark or not, nor whether anything happens to reddit. I just took umbrage with your reasoning.

I haven't found one in Australia much cheaper than $300, and it's not in my budget to buy one for a few more months.

But that would have required me to not eat ice cream, and that's not an option. 

I like to have a pint once a week. Ideally I'd have one every day but I can't afford $10 a day... So clearly the creami is going to pay for itself.

Then Muhammed personally smashed every statue in the one in Mecca, claimed it's for muslims and then invented a story about how Abraham built it even though there is zero historical evidence of Abraham existing let alone going to Mecca to build a block.",Gizka1235,1686653172.0

FIREUK,"Agents usually have two charges.  One for signing contracts with a tenant, one for the ongoing management.

For signing, the tenant can just move onto a rolling monthly contract.  There is no need to sign a new one if you are happy with that.

For management fees, you can just give notice and work directly with the tenant to solve repairs and collect rent.

The 9% fee sounds like a management fee which you should be able to terminate with notice.  You can then self manage or move to another agent.",Mysterious_Act_3652,1686643707.0

shanghai,"I know it may sound wasteful, but see if it is in your budget to do both.  I have friends who did this and it was very convenient for them because the universities can be very strict about guests, curfews, etc.  Also, the rooms were smaller and sometimes the amenities weren't very good.  This made their off-campus apartments a refuge during vacations and weekends.

On the other hand, it can be a real pain to commute to campus in Shanghai, so having a place to stay on campus would be helpful during the week.  For example, I once took Mandarin courses at ECNU but - even though the campus was normally a 20 minutes away by taxi - it took almost an hour to get to class.  This was because of:

* Morning rush hour.
* The route to campus was mostly two lanes on each side of the road, which was way too small for all the traffic.  I could see it going into the distance forever. 
* The gate at which the bus dropped us off was on the opposite side of campus from where I needed to go.
* We had to use our student ID to get into the campus so there would sometimes be a very long line.
* I could have taken a taxi to the other gate but it wasn't worth it.  It only saved about 10 minutes (due to morning rush hour) and cost about ¬•35 per trip.  I definitely could not afford to do that for five days per week for an entire semester.

When I would be rushing to class, I'd see students in their pajamas (obvious that they had just woken up) walking to class and I would think ""Dammit - I want to stay on campus so I can roll out of bed and get to class in ten minutes"".

I hope this helps!

Kingdom,"Tbh, all the parts where the Generals go around looking at cities like Ousen did for Gyou, Qin getting surprised at Retsubi, and now Tou at Han's capital to scout for potential openings are nothing more than dramatic effects for me. 

>!There was zero chance that the Qin did not know about Retsubi's design considering how close Retsubi was to Qin's border. Even if the Qin wasn't scouting for an opening to siege it, the Qin would still have scouted it to see how big it was, especially its medical facilities, granaries, and its practical value as a launchpad from Zhao into Qin's territory. !<

There was also no travel embargo between the seven states and spies were operating rampantly. Merchants were freely trading and people were migrating everywhere (mainly to Qin). 

The military HQ of these states would have all the details and information on all the notable cities and settlements. All they needed to do was send an experience builder attached to the army on a scouting mission all over and report back to their home state. 

And since city gate guards were habitually corrupt those days, it just couldn't be easier for anyone to smuggle out carved-out notes containing key features and elements in a city's build in relation to defense.

Wingstop Atomic has to be the hottest of the fast food chains though, and even in my love of extreme heat, especially Habanero, the hottest of Jalape√±os, ocxasionally some Ghost, etc, I always have some atomic when I eat Wingstop, but never too much.

NoStupidQuestions,"YES. Actually, this will actually be more beneficial than trying to start a whole exercise regimen, because you'll be able to keep doing it. It's easy to talk yourself out of going to the gym for an hour, but it's hard to talk yourself out of something that's going to take less than two minutes. 

But the true magic of it is that once you're doing ten push-ups every day for a week or two, you're going to feel stronger, and you're going to feel empowered because you've kept it up. So you might up that to 15 push-ups. Maybe a week later you'll decide to add a ten minute walk. That'll become easy, and it'll turn into a longer walk -- and you'll realize that this daily walk is actually doing wonders for your mental health, too. Maybe you'll want to start doing two walks a day. Or the walk will feel easy that you'll say, ""Hey, I'm going to try to jog for 30 seconds and walk the rest of the way.""

This is how genuine change happens. Small, tiny, manageable increments that you can sustain. I wish more people would preach *this* instead of big changes that are hard to stick with. 

You've got this. Do those 10 push-ups. When it feels good -- and it WILL feel good -- just add a little something else.",BrigidKemmerer,1686656184.0

10s,"For control racquets I have tried pro staff v13, pure strike vs and gravity pro 2023. I would recommend gravity pro. 

That is only if you are ready and have good technique, ie you are no longer using your arm but the power comes from your unit turn and racquet drop. It's very soft, I feel minimal impact when I full strike the ball and you can rip balls with it all day but it is 315 grams and the swing weight is 330+. So if you don't know how to swing properly you will get tennis elbow. The 100 SQ racquet is also good too since you are already using a 100inch. I m too used to smaller head sizes so I ended up not sticking with it. 

Pure strike vs is very soft unlike the other pure strikes. But it has close to zero power my swing weight came close to 310 which is unusable. To do anything you would need to add some lead to the hoop. I won't go for that if you aren't okay to experiment with lead. But when u do you really have all the control you need. It really isn't for every one tho. You really have to be powerful to use that racquet.",Ok-Manufacturer2475,1686657068.0

learnmachinelearning,"You are probably thinking of data and concept drift. Your variable distribution across many features is changing over time as a function of the model generating a feedback in the data. There are some techniques to identify if/when this is happening, but for those to work, you must have access to metrics internal and external to your model.

With the crime example: if behavior shifts, you will see a drift in distribution on your predictive features. When they drift beyond a threshold, your model performance will start to rapidly decay.
It can also be a drift in target label definitions, like what is a ‚Äúgood loan‚Äù in finance. These are more difficult to catch.

One way to prepare your pipeline for something like this:
- know your domain, have a good understanding of the reality behind the numbers
- tons of EDA and residual analysis to identify edge cases and points of collapse in performance in advance.
- continuous or frequent monitoring and alerts. population stability index is a friend.",CheesyRegression,1686645195.0

navy,"So when CSCSU and TSC merged, the new SCSTC command that owns ET A, ATT, etc gained ownership of the barracks as well, so you may get orders to instruct or to NMTI. The schoolhouse is more than willing to get NMTI‚Äôs stick time to blue badge and ultimately MTS, if that‚Äôs what you get sent to. Or you get ATT, ET A, and you instruct. Duty usually consists of quarterdeck watches, military presence (MILPRES), or barracks duty officer (BDO), where you‚Äôre an NMTI during the off hours, but you‚Äôd be in 8 section duty.

But off the cuff it‚Äôs one or the other usually. And there‚Äôs opportunities to swap between barracks and schoolhouse down the line to make sure you get MTS before you transfer out.

Debian is much mooore predictable. Every 2 years release with refreshed packages, with 3 years of support, sometimes for limited number of packages, for 5 years. And that is last 15 or 20 years. 

openSUSE had regular release when is ready, every 6 months, every 8 months, after year, changed for Leap from version 13.2 into version 42.1, back to version 15.0. Release every year, with major rebase every four years, so after 15.3 should be 16.0, but replaced by 15.4.

French,"Correct. I believe the difference between the two cultures is largely the source of the common American impression or fear that French people are ‚Äúrude.‚Äù Americans are conditioned to engage in ‚Äúlook at me, and make a big deal out of me!‚Äù types of behavior. (I blame untrammeled capitalism.) They will also try to make a big deal out of you as a French person, thinking this is ‚Äúnice‚Äù: ‚ÄúYour English is SOOO amazing. It is AWESOME!!!‚Äù 

Coming from a culture that values being a bit more understated, French people may be embarrassed even by these well-meaning attempts at connection. Meanwhile, Americans might expect French people to lavish praise on them for speaking French, even if they are doing so at an A1 level. 

We tend to forget that many Europeans have spent a decade or longer learning and practicing English and that they expect zero praise even though they have attained a high level of proficiency. Why? Because this is pretty normal in Europe. While they might enjoy practicing English and feel proud at times of their fluency, they mostly use English as a form of practical communication between people from different countries. It‚Äôs the quickest way to get a transaction done, not always a bonding moment where you comment on the other person‚Äôs accomplishments.

In the United States, though, the vast majority of native-born people are monolingual, so learning French or Italian IS unusual. We‚Äôll start speaking our new language around the house to impress our family after about two lessons. 

(Personally, I love it when Americans try to open up and learn about other cultures and languages as it may reduce the chance that we incinerate the planet.)

* In Low Chaos, Emily makes a drawing for Corvo of his face labeled 'DADDY', to match one she's already made of Jessamine labeled 'MOMMY'.
* In Havelock's final diary entry he writes about Corvo's ""loyalty to the Kaldwin women"" and wonders if Emily is really his daughter (as a military man he may have been less in-the-know for the court intrigues).
* In High Chaos, in the final mission Pendleton tells Corvo that ""everyone knew"" about the relationship

Corvo never yells from the rooftops that Emily is his kid, but it's quite clear that this was the intent of the writers.

By the second game, set fifteen years after the first, it's well known to be fact that Corvo and Jessamine were a couple, and Emily was their child. It's mentioned in several in-universe books, if you play as Emily in Low Chaos she can mention she's half-Serkonan in a speech, and she regularly calls Corvo ""Father"".  My headcanon is that after Jessamine's death and Emily's coronation, there's a lot less pressure to hide the relationship - after all, what are they gonna do? Find another Empress?

These days, I couldn't give a flip. Are they clean? Are they a good person? Do we share the same morals? Sex is just sex. Sex with someone you love is different.

Otherwise, maybe you eat too much at lunch. A particularly big meal can make people sleepy, especially when it's hot on top of it. You could try to eat less at lunch, even if that means eating more in the evening.

wrestling,"I coached wrestling for years, starting at youth/middle school and now helping out on the high school team. I enjoy wrestling the big high schoolers.

wildrift,"I quit lol about a year ago (was playing every moment I wasn't at work. It was ruining my life). WR is a quick fix when I have the craving to play, but it lacks the depth, especially as a jungler. 

-rune system is way less impactful on your playstyle than in regular league. Plus, waaaay less runes to chose from.
-lots of things make the game play far easier (buff sharing in the late game) 
-smite auto upgrades super fast, and there is only one option. I don't know if they changed the way it worked on PC league recently, but there used to be different types of smite. 
-way less Champs means there is a way higher chance your champ is ether picked or banned. 
-leashing is gone because jungle clear is so easy. 
-my main isn't and probably never will be in the game (this is personal and I get nobody else cares about my main) 
-less items means less build expression, and lots of the cool items in the game have been gutted to be nothing more than a damage item (duskblade) 
-game practically marks last hits which makes last hitting way to easy. 
-respwan timers are so short and the map is so small soloing objectives early, which was commonplace on PC, doesn't really happen in WR. 

Those are the main things I miss from PC league.",HighDPSGlizzy,1686661406.0

A few hours away is a college and they seem to have a boil water notice every few weeks. The school has it own treatment center but is designed to small or atleast was designed for average hourly flow vs poop before a test flow ha. It flowers to the towns treatment system but seems like atleast once or twice a month they have a boil water notice due to them both being maxed out and having to release stuff early.

Not sure of the numbers but say like 5-7k people live on the campus but folks commuting to college might be like 15k+ a day. So you get tons of folks come in after a decent to long drive to take a big test and a whole lot of flushing done at once ha.

That's funny coming from you, the only true danger is you. If you like go into the fascist speech to defend your words. Having your own thoughts or words is fine even if it's bizarre and stupid, freedom of speech is exists. But don't be surprised if you get compliments, uncomfortable stares, insults, or even arrested for your speech. If you say that everyone deserves rights, people can react and agree, if you say racism is justified, people can be upset with you, if call a random stranger an idiot, you could get decked in the face for it.

So say what you want but people can react, your speech comes with consequences depending on what you choose to spew from your mouth. People have the rights to react to what you say.

#define X9_PRINT_ERROR_MSG(msg) x9_print_error_msg(msg)

MiniPCs,">i need it for solidworks...

This single statement defines the whole direction.

Whether desktop or laptop, for Solidworks to properly be supported, our clients have found that two details cannot be sidestepped. And they've tried.

32GB RAM

4GB dedicated VRAM

Unless you can find a great deal, new or used, on a Minisforum HX80G 32GB, mini PCs fail to make the ‚Ç¨500 cut.

>X300 or B660

We have clients that have both, and the general consensus between them is X300 ownership provides better performance and a more economical build than the B660.

Going with the X300, you'll want to focus on Zen 3 Infinity Fabric Architecture for the best optimization. Most of our clients, in the past year, have chosen the Ryzen 5 5500. It's the least expensive Zen 3 to meet the requirement, and comes with a fan and heat sink.

Depending on your region's availability, one of the most popular 32GB 3200Mhz kits is Silicon Power's SP032GXLZU320BDC. Often in the ‚Ç¨55 price range, they have found this to be the most stable Zen 3 budget RAM available.

The Radeon RX 580 is an excellent choice, and often overlooked. Backed by 32GB of RAM, the 8GB of VRAM gives Solidworks optimal room to perform. There's an approximate 35% GPU bottleneck, which is actually to be expected with an older card like the RX 580. In terms of bottlenecks, a GPU bottleneck is considered better than a CPU bottleneck, as the system will still have processing power.

And for best support overall, make sure that you invest in a Gen3x4 NVMe SSD, with read/write speeds of at least 3,000/2,000MHz. Once again, a client favorite is the Silicon Power 512GB SU512GBP34A80M28AB, R/W up to 3,400/2,300MB/s. SolidWorks, along with Windows, tends to read/write the storage simultaneously. A faster NVMe is less noticeable.

We hope this information helps.

#Do not ask for medical advice, and do not play doctor

What constitutes medical advice?
***

* ""What is this?"" 

 This is asking someone to diagnose the issue, and is medical advice.

* ""What should I do?""

This is asking someone to advise treatment, and is medical advice.

 * ""Should I go to the doctor?""

This is asking if you should seek treatment, and ergo, medical advice. 


**If you would ask the question of your doctor, it falls under this rule and not allowed. As a general rule, asking for medical advice from internet strangers is never a good idea. If you have questions regarding your condition, you are advised to contact your healthcare provider. If you are a medical provider, we would gently remind you that users are not patients, and you should not be offering medical advice to people who are not your patients.**

3. Rob added me to the original invite
4. My inbox show the invite with Sorry...No updates happen

Solution
1. In my android phone find invite from Rob (real organizer)
2. Scroll down on the invite and find the ics file attached to it. 
3. Click to download 
4. Find downloaded file on notifications and click it 
5. Calendar event opens and at the bottom it says ""update event"" (something like that)
6. Click that
7. Now rob shows as the organizer and I no longer have the issue. Further updates sent by Rob do stick and apply

Make soft mewing second nature, correct your neck and body posture, learn the proper swallow pattern,chew hard foods, hard gum like mastic, and get out of your comfort zone, exercise daily. 

I'm sure if you can do these things for the next say 5-10 years, you are very much on path to achieve significant results.  

You could upswing your jaw which could ultimately lead to an increase in your Ramus length.

GakiNoTsukai,"Morning Membahs, here is a little excerpt from Minna no Ie („Åø„Çì„Å™„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„Åà) or known as ""All About Our House"" directed by Mitani Koki (most will remember him from the fifth Silent Library or GnT episode #0906)  
  
I've seen Bus Jack, Bus Jack Returns, R100, Saya Samurai, Siren, and Symbol, but not Minna no Ie until last night. I found it to be an endearing little tale that made me nostalgic of the early 2000s, so I thought I'd share.  
  
It's a charming story about a happily married couple and their home.  
A screenwriter (Tanaka Naoki) and his art teacher wife (Yagi Akiko) decide to build a new house in the countryside. The work is split up between the interior designer friend (Karasawa Toshiaki) and the master carpenter (Tanaka Kunie) who is also the wife's father.   
  
Two wills clash when the interior designer's modernist vision collides with the master carpenter's traditional methods. A puppydog Tanaka is caught between his father in law and his wife's friend. Despite having to mediate between the father's stubborness and the friend's novel vision, he has complete faith and confidence in both's skill and expertise.  
After trials and tribulations the two artisans come to mutually respect each other for their skills and values. The house is finished with traditional and modernist elements albeit with a main door that opens outwards, and a japanese room that might be too big...  
A wonderfully quaint story about the chaos of building a home for one's family.

At the 2002 Japanese Academy Awards Minna no Ie was nominated for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Newcomer, Best Screenplay, and Most Popular Actor. Of which it won Best Newcomer for Tanaka Naoki and Yagi Akiko. Tanaka-san also won Most Popular performer.",FluffySeaPancake,1686661045.0
udub,"Greek folks aren't very welcoming to non-traditional students. Or at least the sororities sure as fuck weren't. Maybe the frats will be different. Dry frats are a good option if you're going Greek, although beware that doesn't mean the guys don't party, it just means there's no alcohol allowed inside the house (and they may not strictly adhere to that rule either). At least one of the frats I remember went dry as punishment for something or another in the past. I can't say much about the non-party ones. Greek life doesn't usually see much of them for obvious reasons so not many people can recommend much in the way of them.

You should definitely ""interview"" very well with a frat before you decide to join. Being 25 is a lot different from being 18. Even at 23 I don't think I'd join a sorority again, I'm in a much different place now.",commanderquill,1686643562.0

I'm using a laptop with a Intel iGPU and Nvidia dGPU

But when I tried to run ' rmmod nvidia' to detach nvidia gpu, it stated nvidia was used by a process, that PID was not appear in `top`.

I guess that's Display Manager (SDDM) using it? ( later proved it was the DM)

Necrontyr,"Are Kodex started off in ninth edition like it was already behind because even though we got a significant greenish refresh of new data sheets and units, overall many of the characters and units were over priced for what they did.

To make things worse, they were a lot of rules that got in each other‚Äôs way and D synergized certain abilities. For example, you could not roll the animation protocols on models that were destroyed outside of the shooting phase and fight phase. So if you got charged by orcs and they had a special rule that caused damage on a successful charge you were out of luck. Then you had to deal with the psychic phase where psychics damage completely prevented reanimation protocols from activating.

And lastly, we animation protocols didn‚Äôt even really work on units that had multiple wounds.

Then we had dynastic agents which created all sorts of confusing scenarios, because a lot of people read the rule incorrectly because GW should have made it just a short and sweet explanation. For example, dynastic agents never receive any dynastic codes. Many players assumed this meant Praetorians did not benefit from the second directive on the round your dynasties saver protocol was active, which was incorrect.  Favorite protocols are a diagnostic code but it‚Äôs affecting the protocol itself. It‚Äôs not a code that is given to Praetorians. You will notice when you read the section on command protocols because it states that all units in your army game, the benefits of all the active command protocols that round as long as that unit has the command protocols rule on their data sheet which Praetorians do. The three Catan shards do not, and will not ever receive command protocols because they have the enslaved star gods rule, which is different. 

The main point for dynastic agents is that they do not break your army rules for including them in your army, despite the fact that they lack your dynasties keyword.

Another good example which didn‚Äôt hit me until later in the addition, was that overlords with resurrection orbs could never use them to target Triarch Praetorians, which completely made my head pop.

When you read the rule on resurrection orbs, it states that you have to target a friendly dynasty unit, and unfortunately Praetorians, although they may be friendly, they do not have the dynasti part. 

I think a lot of this was unintentional by the designers. And I think they were trying to pull their punches and fear of writing an overly strong Kodex, yet instead reanimator‚Äôs, came out of the door at 120 points, and they are range, which was 9 inches in the inDominus rulebook down to 6 inches when the official court rules were released.

Everybody scoffed because no one‚Äôs going to pay 120 points for a monster, which made it extremely hard to benefit from cover, and you had to be in constant line of sight, and within 6 inches of the target you were trying to heal while having a toughness score of five with only five wounds.

And then they decided to troll us by giving him pretty decent guns, which shot out a total of six ranged attacks that had a strength of six and I believe the AP was -2 however, the range was only 12 inches. How are you going to shoot 12 inch guns when you‚Äôre sitting as far back as you can which is 6 inches in order to keep your healing beam on that one unit you‚Äôre following around while trying to stay out of line of sight.

And then there were locust heavy destroyers I believe they were 70 points each when they first came out from one model that was toughness five with four wounds. These fat chunky boys with access to one of the only reliable shots we had when shooting at dangerous targets would cost over 200 points for a unit of three yet they were easy to one shot and then as the game went on suddenly a lot of other units we‚Äôre getting access to, 2+ armor saves which we only see in the Necron Codex on titanic units like the monolith.

Since they started giving 2+ to certain units in the Admech Codex, and then increasing their invulnerable, saves from 6+ up to 5+ kind a got under my skin, because the name of the rule that gave them the invulnerable save, was called cybernetic enhancements on their rangers.

Meanwhile, Necron warriors who were 100% covered in metal did not receive a natural invulnerable save .

There‚Äôs so many feel bad moments about ninth edition for that faction I just get irritated talking about it .

Towards the end of ninth edition, there were so many Band-Aids. They actually ended up in validating, certain relics and stratagems through the dataslate. 

Doomstalker could‚Äôve been pretty decent if they had just been more specific or did something a little stronger with the sentinel construct rule, which allowed it to Overwatch each time a friendly unit what is the target of a charge while within 6 inches of it. I remember there was a clause in parentheses that said, as a Doomstalker was also  the target of that charge.

That last line was extremely important, because there were abilities and command protocols that could trigger it to overwatch on a five and a six, making the Doomstalker a charge deterrent",Tanglethorn,1686664846.0

juridischadvies,">Voor de duidelijkheid: er is hier nooit iets expliciet over gezegd, tot twee weken terug toen de huisbaas via mail stuurde dat het terras gemeenschappelijk is. Dat lijkt me toch ook wel te lezen als een rechtsgeldige afspraak?

Vind ik een lastige. Het is in ieder geval niet netjes, maar vraag is of hier een afspraak is die afdwingbaar is. Een belofte is normaal gesproke niet afdwingbaar als die geen deel uitmaakt van een (wederkerige) overeenkomst. Bij een wederkerige overeenkomst geldt bv dat Pietje A geeft aan Klaasje, en Klaasje daar B voor teruggeeft. Bv huur betalen voor een woning. Omdat jij hier geen tegenprestatie hebt (je betaalt niet voor het gebruik van het terras) kan dat dus lastig zijn. Echter, er zitten veel haken en ogen aan het verbintenissenrecht en anderen op deze sub zijn daar veel beter in thuis.

Wat betreft vluchtwegen zijn er in Nederland [normen](https://rijksoverheid.bouwbesluit.com/Inhoud/docs/wet/bb2012/hfd2/afd2-12), helaas zijn die voor de leek behoorlijk complex. 2 vluchtwegen zijn niet altijd verplicht, soms is 1 vluchtweg voldoende. Ik durf niet te zeggen of in jouw situatie afdwingbaar is of die brandtrap ook voor jou toegankelijk moet zijn. Wel lijkt het me in algemene zin vreemd als die afgesloten kan worden door 1 bewoner. Ik zou bij de verhuurder erop aandringen dat die brandtrap altijd toegankelijk moet zijn. Dat wil op zichzelf dan nog niet zeggen dat je het terras daarmee ook mag gebruiken als terras.",McMafkees,1686666587.0

fragrance,"1. I think I follow in a big part the cultural norms I am raised in when choosing fragrance for myself (I'm European, 38F, heterosexual), also considering that I'm  wearing mostly European brands who employ mostly European perfumers. When a perfume is inspired by other cultures, such as using oud, it's always within the European interpretation. So I'm mindful of that. However, getting into niche fragrances some years ago has helped me realize how any person can really wear anything, the only rule is that we like it.

2. Perfume is self expression and confidence, yes.
3. I have a lot to say about class. In the US, I've noticed that class is often talked about along with race and gender, but in my culture class is a separate issue and there is a whole theory that cannot be replaced witb post modern ones. Not saying that other issues are not important, I just cannot view it as the same as class overrides all. I understand though, that in the US the atmosphere is very, very different, for example, there is a hostile environment against queer groups and banning drag shows that here in Europe we cannot believe it's real!! So, I think that fragrance showcases class, yes. It always will. There's no way around it. The bottles in someone's shelf show their status, as does someone's handbag logo when they carry it. There are always discussions on ""smelling expensive"" or ""smelling like cheap body spray"" for example. This is like it is. The snobbery of the perfume communities and shops, don't get me started on that.

As for moderation, we all need to have a respectful environment to discuss fragrance. I don't think banning words is the solution, unless they are slurs. Or removing comments. Unless it's insulting a person's or a group's dignity. But having a healthy disagreement is part of any free and progressive society. And we can agree to disagree respectfully. It seems there is room for only one ideology while there are plenty, as well as everything in between. I might be wrong, you might be wrong, but we have the right to be wrong as long as we don't insult people and are civil towards each other always.",myrrhardente,1686669403.0

NewYuzuPiracy,"running almost all of the same settings as OP except:

* **No Steam Frame limit** (just the 30fps lock from the static 30 mod) because I was experiencing crazy input lag when doing static 60 and then steam frame limiting to 30 (more on fps later)
* **No Island Fix mod**. I may be wrong, I never tested it to see if it got a mystical performance improvement... but my understanding was this was only for 2x and up scaling. And you're pretty much locked to 1x (720p) on the Deck
* And the biggest difference... **SteamOS 3.5**. I think I was running almost exactly this setup and also experiencing exactly what OP was experiencing. And then I decided to just test out SteamOS 3.5 and now I'm **averaging** 29-30fps probably. Big dips are in dense areas (Lookout, Kakariko, etc) where it goes sometimes to low 20s and also random very quick dips to \~15 which I think is shader caching because it almost always happens in areas I've never been and it's pretty infrequent. 

These claims are not lies? I couldn't be bothered to record my performance and I'm sure other people have... But if enough people are like, ""yes, I need the proof"", I can make a video. Feels wild that there's a post like this without exploring an enormously easy and well-documented way to increase performance (OS 3.5).

So you can drill sequencing for hours and not let your brain go to mush. 

How long did it take me? Honestly, I still learn a thing or two from LG, but it's more different inferences I can make to make me even *more* efficient.

Only reason I'm not using them as much is because of the index fight, they're slightly resistant to blunt stagger AND they use the same dog piling strat I use (the AI is getting smarter wtf). But I'll definitely review the sweepers cards again to see what I can use to survive the enemies dog piling.

The only reason I never used guns is simply because you know run out of cards and I'm scared I'm not going to do enough damage if I had a deck full of guns. I'll review some gun cards and see if I can fit 1 or 2 cuz I hate losing clashes constantly and damage has been low lately.

And this might be a bit late but how do I do general receptions, as in what do I click in the game to get the general invitations? Cuz I think all I've been doing is the story mission and no side content but I'm not sure.

learnmachinelearning,"Howdy, no worries back propagation is the sharpest part of the learning curve in neural networks. Please forgive my poor video quality (one of the first), but I try to explain how back propagation works with in this code from scratch tutorial here: [https://youtu.be/x2YmEX1XzGI](https://youtu.be/x2YmEX1XzGI) as an additional resource. As well as 3 Blue 1 Browns video [https://youtu.be/tIeHLnjs5U8](https://youtu.be/tIeHLnjs5U8) 

To abridge the idea of back propagation more it sorta works like this:

error : is the **derivative of your loss function**  
find the gradient of error with: **error \* derivative\_of\_activation(prediction)**  
find the change in weights by:  
**dot(layer\_before\_inputs , gradient )**

just looking at these 3 steps we have the formula to be able to preform backwards propagation on a perceptron ( 2 layer NN ). Notice how all parts of the neural network are used such as the:

* predicted out
* true out
* inputs

the only thing that is not used is the weights, and that is because we are looking to edit them, so they are a 'fixed' value until the end. Now! if we are to increase the layers by 1, to give us a 3rd layer, we now have to find a new gradient for the previous layer. This comes from taking the 

**dot( gradient , weights\_before\_output ) \* derivative\_of\_activation(layer\_before\_output)**

Similar to before everything now gets used in backwards propagation except for the weights right at the input to the first hidden layer. You are chaining along the gradient throughout the neural network and recalculating a new gradient for each layer each time.

The loud minority want so desperately to be YouTubers like Angry Joe and have this passionate vitriol over something.


It can‚Äôt be a simple case of: ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know that I agree with this story point‚Äù. It‚Äôs gotta be :


‚ÄúBLOOBER IS A DISGUSTING TEAM THAT ENCOURAGES DEPRESSED PEOPLE TO KILL THEMSELVES. BOYCOTT THEM! MAKE THEM LOSE THEIR JOBS!‚Äù


The Medium wasn‚Äôt *that* bad. It‚Äôs an interesting concept that‚Äôs forgettable at the worst. 


And no one would even give a shit about their name if it wasn‚Äôt for **Blair Witch**. YouTubers REALLY clung onto that one because it‚Äôs a well known franchise.  But they framed Bloober as this team of incredibly incompetent people because (again) at the worst it‚Äôs just a pretty boring game. NOT the worst game ever made by a loooong stretch.


But to the loud idiots, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúA HUGE INJUSTICE! THEY CANT GET AWAY WITH RUINING THIS FRANCHISE‚Äù. A lot of spoiled brats don‚Äôt even know what a *bad game* is.


And so the seed was planted for bitching about The Medium over *nothing*, and here we are again with Silent Hill 2.

Also, the speed your RAM runs at shouldn't affect WHEA 18 errors, although if you increase RAM speed it also increases the CPU's internal infinity fabric clock to match, and that could cause ID 18 errors. Tho it shouldn't be an issue unless you go above 3600MT/s RAM, but older BIOS versions can have issues before that.",ExtraGround3652,1686669186.0

You sound like a Freud fan. What do you think of his Penis Envy theory and what about his coke addiction: the article I posted isn't a hatchet job because *it's all true.*

America had put Freud on a pedestal ($$) and the rest of the world sees him for what he *actually* was.

I was stunned to come to America in 1992 to find how many young and/or newly qualified therapists seem to worship Freud. The guy was an utter crackpot.

Jung,"I wonder if the solution would be to surrender and accept the power that being perceived as ‚Äòdumb‚Äô or ‚Äòstupid‚Äô has over you, and accepting the inability to change peoples minds if they choose to see you that way. ‚ÄòSo what if I am dumb? Is that something to fear? Why? Would a dumb version of me deserve to be treated this way? Would that version of me care? Is the real bind in my inability to stop trying to prove I‚Äôm not stupid?‚Äô  
The real game you‚Äôre trapped in is not that you need to disprove being dumb, but that you‚Äôre caught in snare of what someone else thinks of you and attempting to manipulate that.  
Let go of the attachment that people need to see you as smart and you won‚Äôt be overwhelmed with shame when you sense others perceiving you as dumb. Rather than fixing the bind, take notice of the things it makes you feel and why you are determined to avoid them.",Androwren,1686667007.0

gigabytegaming,"Chiming in here. Using the same board and having the exact same issues as well. I was able to finally get rid of it (at least until Gigabyte fixes it¬¥s shit) with the info posted in this post. So thanks for that!I want to use 4 NVMEs but can live with 3 for now. Currently, in the fixed state, i have populated M2A (WD-SN850), M2B (WD-SN750) and M2C (WD-N770). It only fixed itself once i moved my third SSD from M2D to M2C.

So to me it looks like that the M2D slot is highly problematic. Looking at the block diagram, this is the one attached to the second Chipset, that also has LAN and WI-Fi attached. That also explains the Intel NIC not working intermittently when the problem is present.Somehow the second Chipset seems to get bamboozled once M2D is populated.

u/MrHugelberg i also answered on your post in TweakTown forums but since my account is new, my posts need approval which only seems to happen once a month at best ;)

And for streaming, it has probably the worst set of sticks available. They are not only small but also not full range. So depending on what you are trying to stream, you will get frustrated.

Yes, I said that players particularly loved the customization aspect of their characters (which was really wide in both Pillars game) and I said that missing on that was disappotining players (many reactions to choose from) and that it could be done still AND be consistent, just requiring more work for providing sensible backgrounds (even as simple as I did above...works.)

You can argue for the extreme interpretation (calling it consumerism is extreme), however no matter what you do, Obsidian exists out of players pockets.

That does not mean to make the game dumber - on the contrary, it established a well-paying player base liking them for their level of narrative - that does not mean however they can go for shortcuts in other aspects.",10minmilan,1686666481.0

ShitLiberalsSay,"I absolutely do not agree with the commenter who already replied to you. It's not even about those countless WWII episodes, or a couple of episodes about the ""evil"" French Revolution, or the extremely Euro-centric interpretation of events; it's mostly about the absolutely insufferable main character with the main character syndrome, and only they and their star-struck sidekicks can save the day!

When Russell T Davies used to run the show (1-4 seasons of the new DW, i.e., the Ninth and the Tenth Doctor), at least all the companions were specifically working-class people, and it felt like the show was relatable, but after that, the show kept getting more and more pretentious and inconsistent (thanks to Steven Moffat, who is like that himself).

I only continued watching because the amazing actors like John Simm, Michelle Gomez, and Sacha Dhawan all played the Master, Doctor's ex-friend and arch-nemesis. It was so satisfying to see the Doctor's smugness fade when the Master was plotting against them.

The other thing I dislike very much is the Doctor's stance against violence, i.e., no guns, violence is always bad, reason will prevail, let's debate. I understand that the Doctor doesn't have to be perfect, but they are always treated like someone you should listen to, like someone who, supposedly, understands everything much better than you do, when in reality they're all about the same stagnant worldview and magical solutions to complex real-life problems.

And with the Doctor's cult of personality, it's either their way or the highway, because they do love their moral high ground, all that power-tripping and control. Even when the ordinary people rise to the occasion, those people need the Doctor to show them the way.

There are many different Doctors, but the patterns I described can be applied to all of them. Your time can be better spent watching another show, I promise you.",_binary_sea_,1686673273.0

Get a player character up and running (a small square with a face is fine for now, if you wish). Then add some walls to collide with. Now you can start making your first levels already.

If you have a friend, ask to go for a coffee, walk, or do something together. If you don't, go get a coffee and ask the barrista how it's going, try to make brief small talk, say hello to people as you walk by, walk around other humans at the mall or workout next to them at the gym.

My great-grandmother married twice - her first marriage resulted in my grandmother, but she divorced her first husband when my grandma was only 3. So the only father she knew was the second husband - who was, like your situation, from a super prominent and well researched family. I made the point to research them and fill their tree out despite him not really being grandma‚Äôs dad. So, your ancestor‚Äôs second wife may not be your blood relation but she may still have played a role in the story of your family regardless.

It would probably be helpful for us to look at data about catastrophic failures in both the US and Russia to get a real understanding. There's not much happening in the US right now so reporting is at usual levels and events like this collision could be happening without drawing much public attention. 

As far as the influence of the media goes, whether things like the Interstate collapse are reported just to highlight the US [eastern coast]'s crumbling infrastructure, (I think) comes out in the wash and cancels out. Ultimately, I have the perception that media companies in Russia and the US are equally biased, at least for the major news networks.

Eve,"Quick thing on the WH here you can put BCs through a medium hole but that‚Äôs besides the point  

Beyond that I slightly agree w the fleet stuff altho I think there‚Äôs a few things. Hurricanes and Feroxes are used by null blobs quite frequently with DNIs, CFIs, and dreks being used frequently by WH groups. Hulltanked BNIs and brutixes are also common. So I do think they have a place in the fleet meta but are quite rigid and not that varied 

As for pve‚Ä¶ I disagree and that‚Äôs solely because of the way BCs are designed. They do more DPS and have more EHP than cruisers, but can only active tank the same amount unless the ship has specific bonuses to it. This means that having lots of BC content would effectively render cruisers useless in the PVE meta because battlecruisers do everything they can do but better. Battlecruisers do deserve some love and so do battleships but they aren‚Äôt and should not be PVE ships.",Spearminty72,1686676199.0

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"No, you‚Äôre completely ignorant on the dating differences and dynamics between men and women. This is what happens when your education is based on feminist ‚Äúequality‚Äù and not reality.

Women decide whom to have kids with, men do not. Women can fire up a dating app and have dozens of suitors within minutes, men cannot. Women can have an abortion (in most states and municipalities in the Western world) and have access to dozens of forms of contraceptives, not men. As the old saying goes, ‚Äúmommy‚Äôs baby, daddy‚Äôs maybe‚Äù.

Your feminist pipe dream about somehow forcing invasive procedures on men rather than simply educating women to choose men based on good criteria showcases how dangerous and damaging leftist ideology can be.",AryaBarzan,1686676285.0
LastEpoch,"I've tried D4 as well. I'd say LE is deeper in terms of mechanics but less rewarding in terms of gameplay. It's a different kind of game, really. LE is a theorycrafting-first action-second game, D4 is a casual-ish action game with some RPG components. 

Here's some comparisons I can think of.

\- In D4, builds are closer to finished (mechanics wise) sooner. After a couple of hours, you're using most of your endgame skills. In LE, you have to level to unlock skills and some you'll only reach several hours in (maybe 5 or more). Then you have to level those skills to spec points into them. Some important skill-defining nodes may be several points (levels) deep. In the long run it's all the same, but builds ramp up slower in LE, I'd say. 

\- In D4, there's more to discover in the world, activities and such, but I think less to discover in terms of systems. After a couple of days, you know most mechanics. In LE, I'm not sure I ever was aware of all mechanics, and uniques and skills often introduce their own effects. 

\- LE is similar to PoE in that there's tons of allways-up affixes (non conditional), like +x% fire damage or +x% attack speed. In a way, it's more straightforward to build a competent character (just stack flat + bonus damage after basic utility like mana cost or move speed is done), if perhaps more difficult to build the perfect one. 

\- This ties in with another aspect: D4 has slower, more tactical combat. LE's gameplay is more your typical zoom-zoom ARPG gameplay. D4's combat is more tactical because of many conditional affixes: damage to close, to dazed, to trapped, to cc, to vulnerable, etc... rather than flat ""here's +50% damage, always"". Because it also makes you manage your mana, you have to carefully decide when to apply the burst of damage depending on the current state of ennemies. LE also has some gameplay that relies on setup through skill chains, like with Dark Quiver. But I think you can more easily make a ""spam fireball"" build than in D4. 

\- LE offers much deeper yet accessible crafting. It's similar to PoE in that you can reroll, extract, add affixes freely. Unlike PoE, the materials are very abundant and you'll be crafting from a couple of hours into the game and all the way up to end game with little restraint, at least when it comes to mid-tier items. There is an RNG component but you can also just add +x% attack speed to a piece if you like. The RNG is whether you'll be able to do it once, twice, etc. I found this a very rewarding system to engage in, whereas I'd never crafted much in any other ARPG before. You can be constantly upgrading gear pieces from okay-ish rares with a couple of relevant affixes by adding other affixes of interest that you've hoarded. 

\- LE has a lot, but a lot lot lot more loot than D4. It gets to the point the game has a built-in loot filter that you can easily customize to precisely target the base items, the affixes, number of affixes etc... that you want. If you don't do that, your inventory will be full by the second pack of ennemies you kill and, honestly, it won't be a good experience. The majority of items will be useless for your build anyways. There's lots of items you pick up as crafting bases or to salvage affixes (much like legendary aspects in D4).",Sharklo22,1686670042.0

SQL,"From ChatGPT....

&#x200B;

The syntax you're seeing is specific to Oracle SQL, and it's used to define an outer join in a WHERE clause.  
  
The (+) operator in Oracle SQL performs the function of an outer join. In an outer join, all the rows of one table are returned (the ""left"" table, or in your case, table\_1 a), along with matching rows from another table (the ""right"" table, or in your case, table\_2 b). If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.  
  
This syntax is a little more old-fashioned compared to the ANSI SQL 92 syntax for outer joins, which most developers are more familiar with.  
  
The equivalent of your query in ANSI SQL syntax would be:  
  
FROM table\_1 a LEFT JOIN table\_2 b ON a.id = [b.id](https://b.id)  


This does the exact same thing: returns all rows from table\_1 a, along with any matching rows from table\_2 b. If there's no match, the columns for table\_2 b will be filled with NULLs.  
  
While this Oracle-specific syntax can be confusing if you're used to ANSI SQL syntax, it might be used in older systems or by developers who prefer it for some reason. However, the trend is towards using ANSI SQL syntax because it's more standardized and easier for most people to understand.  
  
As for benefits, there are no particular benefits of using (+) over ANSI standard syntax for LEFT JOIN. In fact, using ANSI syntax is generally recommended for its readability and portability between different SQL implementations. The (+) syntax is Oracle-specific and not universally understood or implemented.",sequel-beagle,1686667328.0

For your scenario, a ""Random"" button only works in your favor *if* somebody else uses the Random button.  But as you see from yourself and your data, people don't want to do random Elites - they want to do very specific ones. 

I personally would probably never use a Random Elite button. The PUG experience in Elites is just awful and always has been. The game doesn't enforce any gear/dps restrictions, so unless you can carry it yourself it's just a frustrating waste of time.",Plan_Tain,1686675472.0

I lkinda rolled my eyes  You're 25. 

You have plenty of time to find someone. There's no rulebook as to when you have to meet someone by. 

If you want kids, obviously the chances of that get thinner as you get older but plenty of women get pregnant at 35+. 

Even if you met someone next week. There's no guarantee that it'll be forever. That's life, that's dating. 

You gotta keep trying. 

I didn't meet my current partner until I was 35. I kept telling myself I'd be alone forever but I picked myself up and put myself out there and I met the most amazing man.

castiron,"During the 17th century, brass was the preferred metal for English cookware and domestic utensils, and the Dutch produced it at the lowest cost, which, however, was still expensive.[1] In 1702, Abraham Darby was a partner in the Brass Works Company of Bristol, which made malt mills for breweries.[2] Apparently in 1704, Darby visited the Netherlands, where he studied the Dutch methods of working brass, including the casting of brass pots.[3] Darby learned that when making castings, the Dutch used molds made of sand, rather than the traditional loam and clay, and this innovation produced a finer finish on their brassware.[4] In 1706 he started a new brass mill in the Baptist Mills section of Bristol.[5] There, Darby realized that he could sell more kitchen wares if he could replace brass with a cheaper metal, namely, cast iron.[6] Initial experiments to cast iron in sand molds were unsuccessful, but with the aid of one of his workers, James Thomas, a Welshman, he succeeded in casting iron cookware.[7] In 1707 he obtained a patent for the process of casting iron in sand, which derived from the Dutch process.[8] Thus, the term ""Dutch oven"" has endured for over 300 years, since at least 1710.[9][10] The Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Researching Food History[11] agree that several very different cooking devices were called ""Dutch ovens"" ‚Äî a cast-iron pan with legs and a lid; a roughly rectangular box that was open on one side and that was used to roast meats, and a compartment in a brick hearth that was used for baking.",12voltViking,1686677956.0

unpopularkpopopinions,">If people especially men would stop sexualising women and women themselves stop participating in any acts that support the sexualising of women (directly or indirectly), then maybe women might not be sexualised anymore

I agree with you that the sexualization of women is a big historical problem. It's something that goes way back to thousands of years ago. But I take issue with this part of your comment for a few reasons.

Women have every right to express their own sexuality and be as sexual as they want (i.e. dancing, or lyrics or whatever else). Sex is a natural thing that many women want to be open about. Many women want to feel sexy and desired, they want to connect with other humans through sex, they want to express themselves in sexual ways, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that.

The issue with women expressing their sexuality is that sometimes, they're not doing it for themselves but to play into male fantasies, even at the expense of their own safety or mental wellbeing. The biggest problem I have with the idol is that it's telling the story of a vulnerable woman through the lens of a male writer/director who does not value that woman's sexuality outside of her relationship to men. The sex scenes are unrealistic and corny because they show a man's misconception of what sex means to women, rather than what sex is actually like for women.

Jocelyn expresses her sexuality to please others (her management team, Tedros, etc.) rather than for herself. This is actually pretty realistic to how a lot of women in the entertainment industry are treated. But the show gets confused in its messaging and tries to satirize the problem of oversexualizing women while also...oversexualizing women. It ultimately defeats its own purpose, which is pretty disappointing because Jocelyn's character and story is otherwise very compelling.

Moving on from the show though, addressing your second point: the sexualization of women is never going to stop. Ever. It doesn't matter if every single woman covers themselves from head to toe and never leaves the house, women will still be objectified, sexualized, raped, abused etc. Misogyny and the way women are treated/viewed is so deeply ingrained in societies, religions, biology, culture - it's never going to stop for as long as women exist. Which, as a woman, is super depressing. But it's true and it's also total bullshit to suggest that women should stop expressing their sexuality in order to stop being objectified.

All of this is to say that misogyny and the oversexualization of women is a complex issue. There are ways that women can be sexual that are ultimately harmful to themselves or don't have anything to do with self empowerment. But there are also many ways women *can* express their sexuality that empowers them, reflects their true feelings toward sex, etc. and it's important to make that distinction.",sunmi_siren,1686677706.0

KingkillerChronicle,"I too doubt Ambrose will rise to King, it would require his father being killed as well as everyone between him and the throne (like 6 people) at which point there wouldn't be a king, it would be all-out war between like 3 or 4 kings. 

I'm willing to bet that the King Kvothe kills is either Calenthis or the Maer or both.


I'm currently a fan of ""both"". 

The Maer Kvothe has already ""killed"" when he removed his doctor, who was, in fact, giving him a cure for a cancer of sorts (likely would have killed him eventually but maybe far slower). This is strongly foreshadowed by the repeated references to deadnettle and Kvothes confidence in areas he shouldn't be. 

If the Maer dies from an illness, lady lackless would literally march an army on the university to get the Ruh bastard.

The only thread I can see Kvothe following that leads him to killing the Aturn king is he is somehow connected with the Chandrian and more specifically, Cinder aka Master Ash. But so far we only have foreshadowing of that, some of which is as vague as the colors of the Cthaehs flowers...

Replacing the fan should be rather simple, if you make sure to remove the fan connector gently without ripping it off the board, it should just be that and a few screws. If you have one of those heatsinks where you have to take off the heatsink to take apart the fan, I would recommend to follow a YT tutorial for your model. If you take your time and are gentle, it should be fine.

entitledparents,"I did learn a lot, and I still list it on my resume. It was the AIDS Services Center, which was an assessment and referral agency. This was in the late '80s, so it was during the peak of the AIDS epidemic. I initially did secretarial work, like answering phones, filing and running out for lunch. But I got to a point where I was able to handle many of the incoming calls myself instead of having to transfer them. I ended up volunteering more than when I was suspended. I went out to the various colleges in the area to hand out condoms and give talks about safe sex to students.

I also sometimes provided childcare for a woman who worked there part time who had an eight year old son with autism. If I was suspended, his mom would bring him to work instead of to the daycare center. He didn't like most people, but he decided I was okay, and he liked hanging out with me more than going to daycare. He barely spoke, and I learned quickly how to figure out what he wanted through nonverbal cues. His mom even paid me (although we had to keep that secret from my mother).

oklahoma,"My mother lamented the new law. She used to call up the neighborhood bootlegger to have liquor delivered. It is now against the law to have liquor deliver in this state.

Also, the state was the penultimate in the US to legalize liquor by the drink (ordering a drink at the bar.) It was ‚Äúliquor by the wink‚Äù, requiring you to be a member of the local club, since clubs could serve members from their own drink bottles, could legally only provide setups. It meant that every bar you drank at would have a cheap bottle with your name on it. Changed in 1984. We still have some dry counties, where it is illegal to purchase liquor.

Other wacky booze facts: Craig v. Boren was a 1974 US Supreme Court landmark case about gender equality, especially as it discriminated against men.

Biohackers,"Insurance is a B but I was fortunate enough to get an in-lab sleep test first go around when I complained about fatigue and brain fog -my wife also noted me gasping and moaning in pain at night which probably helped. There‚Äôs a lot of moving parts to get a proper sleep test, but again I got pretty lucky with how thorough they were without me prompting them.

I‚Äôm in the US though so YMMV.

Look into AASM1a and AASM1b standards for sleep disorders. Insurance tends to only use the older of the two for testing (can‚Äôt remember which) but what really REALLY matters is that your sleep test scores AHI and RDI. RDI is the new standard that scores all forms of respiratory disturbances whereas AHI leaves out RERAs as a measure.

I was diagnosed a year ago and am only just now getting proper treatment due to wait times for doctors and insurance generally being hard to work with. Find an extremely well regarded sleep doctor or ask about common sleep doctor referrals from your PCP. A large majority of them only prescribe cpap machines without doing much else and that‚Äôll unfortunately lead you into an insurance dead end if you‚Äôre cpap intolerant -which admittedly is uncommon but it did happen to me. Finding a sleep ENT is ideal, but they‚Äôre very rare and I‚Äôm currently seeing a pulmonologist because of this.

I‚Äôd say looking into UARS is required reading if your AHI from your previous test is below 5, but keep in mind that the information is pretty slim and it isn‚Äôt well agreed upon.",Dilliciousness,1686677552.0

You may be right about the rejection and she needed some to comfort her be the cushion to speak to help her soften a blow. In the past I established some firm set of desires but she would do it for one day then return back to her resentful self. 

I think she sees me as the problem here because I'm trying to ask for too much while she is depressed, overwhelmed as a SAHM. However, I don't expect her to be available all the time or text everyday. Her kids are her priority and I respect that.

You can post specific tags tailored to the content you're creating. You can also intertwine the content, this way, both or all hastags for Skateboarding and music.  


Or you can keep things isolated, to a degree.   


I would also factor in how you're making your content. If you're a person that shows himself/herself on camera, its a lot easier to show off your skateboard, cooking supplies, normal things you have around the house or things you like to do...Whatever that is.

However, his career took him all over the world to different colonies, so he had no compunctions about uprooting and traveling. Had he come to the US after getting the diploma, he would have found himself in the Wild West of medicine, and possible the Wild West of the Wild West. Barry practiced from about 1812 to 1859, and even by 1870 the vast majority of physicians in the US were unlicensed, and a sizable minority of them were straight up con artists. He could have forged a convincing enough copy of his diploma with his original name and practiced as a woman, especially with so many remote areas of the US in desperate need of a highly competent surgeon. And who outside of swanky urban medical societies is going to know EXACTLY what a MD diploma from the University of Edinburgh looks like to be able to spot a forgery? So he would not have lived the same life, but likely still could have been a surgeon as a woman.",HutchMeister24,1686674019.0

I think a lot of the end of Bojack shows these characters who were interwoven and dependent upon each other as learning what it is to be okay on their own. That's a good thing. I agree with what someone said about him not being as outlandish and dramatic because he didn't spend a lot of time in LA. He's grounded and he's real. What's more, he acknowledged when he messed up, he apologized, and he tried to make the situation right. Mister Peanutbutter would never. Bojack might've at the end, but never when he and Diane were amicable. 

I don't necessarily love or hate Guy, but that's okay. That doesn't make him a bad character. He's just a feature of the show that didn't catch my attention. I feel the same about Maude and Joey Pogo. I even feel that way about Judah somewhat.",THEwonderburrito,1686680395.0

I meant stronger as in he's well stronger not physically but he overall got stronger stronger his skill and mentality improving throughout the series

It would infact be a one sided onslaught on Johan poor dude doesn't stand a chance against og Dani

His physical stats minus reaction time and perception don't change but he's able to do more as his body doesn't feel pain or the tension in his muscle as well therefore, and the panel literally show him using IA attacks in UI

If it had been her second or third I don't think it would've seemed as bad. 

That said, it could be retroactively ""fixed"" if he has that info she managed to gain on him, relayed to the team by Choso, be ultimately useful. Especially if it's made clear without that info one of the mcs wouldn't just have a tougher time against him but also die.

JapanTravel,"@tribekat, 
Thanks for a seriously quick response.   Here are my answers to your questions;

Is the connecting flight international or domestic Japan
  Domestic by ANA


Do you have checked luggage
  No


What class of service ( = how close to the doors) will you be seated in
  Economy seats in 878  and I believe our seats are close to the middle door. 

How old are the kids (independently mobile + fully able to follow instructions vs if you will need to wait for a gate-checked stroller vs if they might have inopportune bathroom breaks / random tantrums)
9 and 12.  Both can follow my instructions pretty well if I threaten them for no screen time. 

How much hand luggage will you have (wrangling bags while outnumbered by kids is no joke)
Just carryons and backpack.  I planned the trip this way for this reason.",akhst,1686677831.0

NikkeMobile,"Unfortunately SRs in Nikke just don't pull the same weight that low stars can in FGO.  You'll find your story progression walled quite hard at least by the end of chapter 16 if not before without either breaking the 160 wall or having a good team.  

That said, breaking 160 isn't a pipe dream, it's an eventuality.  If you refuse to spend gems on the standard banner and only use the normal tickets for it, it might be a long long ways away eventuality, but you'll get there at some point if you keep playing.

Just want to double check, are you leveling up 5 SRs or all of your SRs?

Skill mats might seem abundant, especially if you're not leveling skills beyond 4.  They're really not.  Level 6 to 7 takes 168 skill 1 and 120 skill 2 mats (+60 code manuals).  Level 9 to 10 takes 273/190/120 skill level 1/2/3 mats (+135 code manuals).",littlemephi,1686680022.0

framework,"Multiple times the the price according to the Apollo developer. Not reddit or anyone else. Twitter charges more than 3x what Reddit is asking and the Apollo dev is using imgur as the benchmark. Imgur has 20 developers. Reddit has 2000. his math is also funky as he was doing revenue per user without acknowledging the fact that his own users are counted towards the user base and give 0$ of revenue to Reddit. Plus those who use ad blocker etc etc

That I agree that reddit is being scummy with the Apollo dev but the dev is doing everything he can to skew this as reddit as the bad guy. He charges a subscription price to his users to access reddit for free.

To pay for staff, at least 200M$ of revenue is needed without talking about servers

Justitia is ass, I recommend running Pierce PT + a Pierce page or two on everyone else. Just pierce the guy to death ASAP, I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to screw with Sin.

Twilight is a mess. Each egg is weak to 1 damage type and very resistant to the others. Bring Purple Tear and build her decks well. Identify Weakness is also good for striking a weakness constantly. In addition, there‚Äôs a lotta Mass Attacks, some of which steal Light. Build your team with good economy, like a lot of copies of Unlock or Will of the City.

Big Eyes is the most problematic phase due to powernull, but pages like Blind Faith or other power loss pages can help. Clone Rapid Gashes can help a lot due to good base rolls. The enemy from Hana Association 2 is also good due to him raising the min/max of dice, which isn‚Äôt affected by powernull.

Speaking of Hana Association 2, I recommend you do it if you haven‚Äôt already. The page you get raises dice min value, which synergizes heavily with Weight of Sin. Run stuff like Fatal Stroke from the Mirae Life Insurance general reception and other pages with low variance between min/max values on him to gain a ridiculous powerstacker that also burns through his own HP ridiculously quickly.

Marriage,"""I proposed to her because I kinda just figured it was the right thing to do""

I think it all started from here. I think you got married to her for the wrong reason. I think you should have started couples therapy since. 

When we are not pregnant, we women, are literally hormonal almost all the time. It's either period hormones, ovulation hormones or PMS hormones raging inside us. Now double, no triple that when pregnant. The thing is no matter how I try to explain it to you to understand, you won't be able to, but I said that to let you know that you have to be patient with her. I am pretty sure everything you have thought of, she has thought of it too. It sounds like you resent her for feeling trapped this young. 

Everything you have now is things you want, just not at this time. I get that but this is your current situation and you cannot pause it. I do not know much to answer if you are compatible enough but I will advise using some form of birth control so the both of you can understand yourselves outside of your children. Your journey might be hard but it won't be impossible. You just have to want to work at it.

I am rooting for you and I wish you all the best

On the client (browser), open a websocket connection and set it to reload the page on any message. This is literally all the code you need.

    ws.addEventListener('message', (msg) => {

Next, you can use a library like [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) to listen for changes in your source directory. Create a [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) server, and whenever a file changes, send a message.

Scripts are great, but for Datascience, imo, the scripts aren't the product, the data and the insights are, and much like when you're developing software, the data and the insights are the things that have to be tested before they're ""deployed"", so the frequent check ins are no different than stopping by a software engineer's desk and having them show the code that they're writing before they've closed the ticket/ reached out to stakeholders for a review/demo.",Popernicus,1686681231.0

Dell,"Update: I sent this to Dell Tech Support on May 21st. They sent me a quote on May 31st of $207 to replace the monitor, even though the BIOS was corrupted.

I declined the repair on May 31st and sent them a note saying I expected Dell to fix it free of charge, since the BIOS update was recommended by Dell. In my note, I said they should send the PC back so I can try again myself. I never talked to anyone, but the logs show a ""phone call"" instead of a note. Did Dell Support change this? Suspicious behavior to erase the written request to have my laptop returned.

There IS record that I declined the repair. There's no way to change your decision on the website. But they sent the same repair quote to me 4 more times over the past week.

BoltEV,"Oh I didn‚Äôt even realize the grey is not included anymore for the base price that sucks. Even so your previous options with no extra charge were only grey or white. 

Getting the charger included with the bolt is also a nice perk. I ended up just having an outlet put in to charge mine with using the mobile charger. That is another cost as well the purchasing of the mobile charger. I also ended up purchasing a ccs adaptor so that is another expense you may have. 

Something else to think about is If you ever plan on taking the car any distances or on any trips that would require charging along the way I would not recommend getting the bolt as the max charge rate is only 55kw. 

Not sure how long you have or what the stipulations are on that 4K state rebate but it may pay for the difference in price as well as the charger. Also not sure if you actually need a car and are commuting but the gas savings every month between buying something now vs waiting is another factor. For me the savings was around $400 a month just on commuting. The savings is probably more now as it‚Äôs summer and we are driving more places.

Anybody who thinks the Victorian Times were a blast need only read the first 4-5 pages of The Ghost Map by Steven Johnson

> IT IS AUGUST 1854, AND LONDON IS A CITY OF SCAVENGERS. Just the names alone read now like some kind of exotic zoological catalogue: bone-pickers, rag-gatherers, pure-finders, dredgermen, mud-larks, sewer-hunters, dustmen, night-soil men, bunters, toshers, shoremen. These were the London underclasses, at least a hundred thousand strong. So immense were their numbers that had the scavengers broken off and formed their own city, it would have been the fifth-largest in all of England. But the diversity and precision of their routines were more remarkable than their sheer number. Early risers strolling along the Thames would see the toshers wading through the muck of low tide, dressed almost comically in flowing velveteen coats, their oversized pockets filled with stray bits of copper recovered from the water‚Äôs edge. The toshers walked with a lantern strapped to their chest to help them see in the predawn gloom, and carried an eight-foot-long pole that they used to test the ground in front of them, and to pull themselves out when they stumbled into a quagmire. The pole and the eerie glow of the lantern through the robes gave them the look of ragged wizards, scouring the foul river‚Äôs edge for magic coins. Beside them fluttered the mud-larks, often children, dressed in tatters and content to scavenge all the waste that the toshers rejected as below their standards: lumps of coal, old wood, scraps of rope.
> 
> Above the river, in the streets of the city, the pure-finders eked out a living by collecting dog shit (colloquially called ‚Äúpure‚Äù) while the bone-pickers foraged for carcasses of any stripe. Below ground, in the cramped but growing network of tunnels beneath London‚Äôs streets, the sewer-hunters slogged through the flowing waste of the metropolis. Every few months, an unusually dense pocket of methane gas would be ignited by one of their kerosene lamps and the hapless soul would be incinerated twenty feet below ground, in a river of raw sewage.
> 
> The scavengers, in other words, lived in a world of excrement and death. Dickens began his last great novel, Our Mutual Friend, with a father-daughter team of toshers stumbling across a corpse floating in the Thames, whose coins they solemnly pocket. ‚ÄúWhat world does a dead man belong to?‚Äù the father asks rhetorically, when chided by a fellow tosher for stealing from a corpse. ‚Äú‚ÄôTother world. What world does money belong to? This world.‚Äù Dickens‚Äô unspoken point is that the two worlds, the dead and the living, have begun to coexist in these marginal spaces. The bustling commerce of the great city has conjured up its opposite, a ghost class that somehow mimics the status markers and value calculations of the material world. Consider the haunting precision of the bone-pickers‚Äô daily routine, as captured in Henry Mayhew‚Äôs pioneering 1844 work, London Labour and the London Poor:
> 
> > It usually takes the bone-picker from seven to nine hours to go over his rounds, during which time he travels from 20 to 30 miles with a quarter to a half hundredweight on his back. In the summer he usually reaches home about eleven of the day, and in the winter about one or two. On his return home he proceeds to sort the contents of his bag. He separates the rags from the bones, and these again from the old metal (if he be luckly enough to have found any). He divides the rags into various lots, according as they are white or coloured; and if he have picked up any pieces of canvas or sacking, he makes these also into a separate parcel. When he has finished the sorting he takes his several lots to the ragshop or the marine-store dealer, and realizes upon them whatever they may be worth. For the white rags he gets from 2d. to 3d. per pound, according as they are clean or soiled. The white rags are very difficult to be found; they are mostly very dirty, and are therefore sold with the coloured ones at the rate of about 5 lbs. for 2d.
> 
> The homeless continue to haunt today‚Äôs postindustrial cities, but they rarely display the professional clarity of the bone-picker‚Äôs impromptu trade, for two primary reasons. First, minimum wages and government assistance are now substantial enough that it no longer makes economic sense to eke out a living as a scavenger. (Where wages remain depressed, scavenging remains a vital occupation; witness the perpendadores of Mexico City.) The bone collector‚Äôs trade has also declined because most modern cities possess elaborate systems for managing the waste generated by their inhabitants. (In fact, the closest American equivalent to the Victorian scavengers‚Äîthe aluminum-can collectors you sometimes see hovering outside supermarkets‚Äîrely on precisely those waste-management systems for their paycheck.) But London in 1854 was a Victorian metropolis trying to make do with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. The city was vast even by today‚Äôs standards, with two and a half million people crammed inside a thirty-mile circumference. But most of the techniques for managing that kind of population density that we now take for granted‚Äîrecycling centers, public-health departments, safe sewage removal‚Äîhadn‚Äôt been invented yet.
> 
> And so the city itself improvised a response‚Äîan unplanned, organic response, to be sure, but at the same time a response that was precisely contoured to the community‚Äôs waste-removal needs. As the garbage and excrement grew, an underground market for refuse developed, with hooks into established trades. Specialists emerged, each dutifully carting goods to the appropriate site in the official market: the bone collectors selling their goods to the bone-boilers, the pure-finders selling their dog shit to tanners, who used the ‚Äúpure‚Äù to rid their leather goods of the lime they had soaked in for weeks to remove animal hair. (A process widely considered to be, as one tanner put it, ‚Äúthe most disagreeable in the whole range of manufacture.‚Äù)
> 
> We‚Äôre naturally inclined to consider these scavengers tragic figures, and to fulminate against a system that allowed so many thousands to eke out a living by foraging through human waste. In many ways, this is the correct response. (It was, to be sure, the response of the great crusaders of the age, among them Dickens and Mayhew.) But such social outrage should be accompanied by a measure of wonder and respect: without any central planner coordinating their actions, without any education at all, this itinerant underclass managed to conjure up an entire system for processing and sorting the waste generated by two million people. The great contribution usually ascribed to Mayhew‚Äôs London Labour is simply his willingness to see and record the details of these impoverished lives. But just as valuable was the insight that came out of that bookkeeping, once he had run the numbers: far from being unproductive vagabonds, Mayhew discovered, these people were actually performing an essential function for their community. ‚ÄúThe removal of the refuse of a large town,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúis, perhaps, one of the most important of social operations.‚Äù And the scavengers of Victorian London weren‚Äôt just getting rid of that refuse‚Äîthey were recycling it.",6chan,1686683527.0

wildrift,"It's really funny in aram because since everyone is on a small lane with max range snowball and max ult (3,5k dmg is so stupid imo) you can always one shot at least one guy.

In ranked it's quite hard to setup, for AP Nunu you need to be ahead and do well in all your gank but if you fail a gank (plenty of champ got a dash/cc to counter him) you can easily be killed.
Another thing I noticed is that Nunu AP is really squishy and sometimes in late game you can get kill before reaching ennemies.
I play it sometimes AP in unranked and honestly if you have good setup and get fed early your game will be pure pleasure.

One of the biggest strength of tank Nunu is beeing almost unkillable so you can secure/stealing objectives during team fight (smite + 1st ability= 2k dmg).
Also if tank Nunu fail a gank it's ok you're tanky enough to dive with your ally.

Edited to add - If more explanation is necessary, normal fusion breakdowns by ccs have it setup so you can decide which events to skip.  For the vast majority of the playerbase, it will be one of the 2 summoning events.  Since a lot of us will skip the whole fusion, the OP was playing with that idea by showing how we could skip certain events in this fusion: all of the certain events.",Dodgson1832,1686684051.0

Does it only show ""all clips"" when the account has more than a 1000 clips or should the ""all"" option show every time?   Even if this worked for me, this would be a painful task to do it every time.

Also, I believe I just tried/found an account with 1000+ clips but has clip error(s) which then gives you no way to download the rest of the clips beyond 1000 due to the clip error.  Try ""@duabyakosky"" to see that there is no way to download more than 1000 clips because the option to download more option is not visible due to the clip error message.

So far all the accounts with clip errors I checked with low numbers of clips all had the same issue, there were pictures instead of videos  (I believe .jpgs) that caused the clip issues.  I see a little white box with an arrow inside of it in the upper right hand of the image.

I've lost web browser access to TT probably due to accessing it too many times concurrently, so I'll have to wait until later for other accounts with clip errors to see if any have something different than "".jpgs"".

This is the difficulty in dealing with First Timer Buyer. Expecting everythign to be perfect on day one. The reality is there will always be something which needs to be updated in a property.   


You are correct, a surveyor is merely trying to cover this back, but it does not help you or the buyer. This is normal, but it will drag on.

Ceiling - they already saw the property. 

Any reason for Asbestoes testing? 

You don't need a structural engineer for re-pointing. Did the surveyor ask for this or the buyer?

TrueChristian,"1. If your dad was truly following God, you were on God's mind even leading him to do that. Probably your dad failed in familial responsibilities and was not considerate, I don't believe God calls us to abandon our children. The Bible says for Fathers to provide and not provoke their children, and also to raise them up in the way they should go. Whatever was the right decision, it's in the past now. But the Bible says God makes note of the fatherless and widows, and He is father to the fatherless. At least your dad was doing something good. Plenty of us just had selfish or absent ones.
2. I can empathize with this, but it comes down to what's right and wrong. If you believe Christ is true, then you have been saved from hell. You're watching people who are destroying themselves, but only seeing the ""fun"" part of sin. You're not seeing the private fallout and emotional damage that happens later. Ultimately a lot of these people are destined for hell. It's like they're dressed fancy, with fine glasses and alcohol, dancing on the Titanic. They refuse to believe the ship is going down and mock you, because floating on a lifeboat. And rather than  feel pity for them, you take it to heart that you are missing out.                                                                                                                            Some parts of your social life may have been damaged by being too extreme or handling emotions poorly as a younger person. Maybe you weren't guided properly. But everyone has different issues growing up, no parent is perfect. To me it sounds like you still know in your heart these things are not good, but wish you didn't know.
3. When you are saved you no longer have to worry about Hell. Jesus took the penalty of your sin. All that is required is to believe on Him and to repent. Not to be perfect, because we can't be. We are justified and cleansed by His blood, and the rapture is nothing to be afraid of. While He died, all of your sins were in the future still.
4. That is hard, but hiding those thoughts is not exactly Biblical. Culture made that a bigger issue and the church not following the forgiveness of Christ. It shouldn't be something that has to be hidden, but i do understand how people are and how that could be a problem. Homosexuality is a sin, but the way the church has handled even having the thought or temptation I do not believe is biblical. I have struggled with really dark things and it takes time to work through them, and even straight people have to wrestle with sexual temptation and desire outside of marriage. We all have our crosses to bear, and some are so personal we feel alone. Jesus seeks the lost and lonely, the 1 sheep away from the 99. God has a purpose for your struggle, as hard as it is to hear. 

As a mature person you have to decide if Christ is true or not, which is really what all this boils down to. Some of your issues are from cultural Christianity or are being blamed on it, but really are human failures not God's. You have to decide also whether to be bitter and resentful, or to forgive and move on.

If you accept Christ, you need understand that you are not doomed to Hell, God loves you and cares for you, and ALL things work together for good for those who love him and are called according to His purposes (we all are called to repentance and serving God). God can take your life and turn it for good, and to help you and heal you. We are saved by grace, not works, lest any man should boast.

If you are not healed of your issues, then at least for now, there is a purpose in it. You're being called to draw closer to Him, examine your life, or maybe it is to humble you like Paul's thorn in the flesh. All of us have struggles, things we wish didn't happen, things that have scarred us. God can restore the years the locusts have eaten, even when we can't see a way out or happiness.

nus,">Recipients of the scholarship (scholars) are required to serve a six-year bond with a Singapore-registered company immediately upon graduation

This is incorrect. ASEAN scholarship does not have any bond. However, the scholarship is only awarded after an international student takes up the Tuition Grant, which itself has the 3-year bond.

The S&T scholarship might have a 6-year bond. However, I think if NUS hasn't offered you a scholarship yet, and it's already mid June, likely you did not meet the requirements for this scholarship. But no harm emailing them again to ask.

Even though the NUS website does not explicitly state this, afaik S&T scholarships with 6-year bonds are mainly for Mainland Chinese students with hope that they will integrate to Singapore society and become a PR/citizen. If you think about it, students awarded this scholarship are basically locking their next 10 years in Singapore (4 years undergrad + 6 years working).",google_tech_lead,1686670887.0

""People tend to think the family dog is harmless, but it's not,"" said Durairaj, associate professor of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, who presented his study last month at the American Academy of Ophthalmology's annual meeting.

Yasuo being relatively good now is the same reason I dropped him; wind wall. It's a key component in his balance philosophy that will always dictate him being a good mid laner. Disabling someone's entire kit (TO ME PERSONALLY***) is ass game design and I was tired of getting hate for it by Bronze ADCs for it. While Yone does get hate, I get much less people harassing me or trolling me for playing him nowadays. Literally just yesterday I had someone troll this Yasuo because he just ""didn't want the pick on his team"" but had no issues with me being Yone.

Off my tangent now, Yone's build varies, but I think it's generally good. I've taken a big liking to the Galeforce build, and even moreso Kraken for top lane.
