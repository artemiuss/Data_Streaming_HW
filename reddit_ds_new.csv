"drums","I am into some pretty nutty shit , the drumming on some of the mastodon records is fucking annoying I'll give you that. However Crack The Skye is fucking A+

Here is an unpopular opinion , I find Mario Duplantier annoying sometimes. Dude rips and some of his drum parts are iconic. Ever watched a solo? Unbelievably unimpressive and almost totally centered around....paradiddles it seems. For some reason it really bothers me.","Sphere369","1686602185.0"

"YouShouldKnow","I had a phone that was so poorly designed it called 911 20 times in 3 hours. It was locked in my pocket on silent while it did this. 
Any incorrect password would trigger a ""do you need 911?"" screen with a giant button to call 911. 

So it would get an input and then go to that screen. Another input? Calling 911!","NotsoGreatsword","1686601147.0"
