redfall,">People also aren't a doofus for cutting down nonsense complaints and pointing out hypocrites. It's because it's an Xbox title.

Fair enough, and agreed. But at the moment you're talking to people who wanted this game to succeed and gave it a fair shot. Sometimes a bad game is a just a bad game.

&#x200B;

>Starfield is STILL getting flack despite just having an amazing showcase all because it's 30FPS.....

I mean, that's fair, i'd be slightly annoyed if I was forced to play at 30fps on my next gen console. Luckily I don't restrict myself to a single platform.

>You don't truly hope for anything positive.

Haha wow, I was soooooo close to respecting your point of view until I read that garbage. I love Arkane games, and I love looter shooters but this isn't it. I hope it shapes up so I can give this one another playthrough but we all know this is gonna be a few patches and move onto the next project type deal.

>Half the guy's list was stuff that is being worked on, can be worked on or was literally a preference/nitpick.

Should have never released like this to begin with, dude was simply sharing his experience with the game, and gripes. Most of if not all of them are valid.

killteam,"I'm not sure I agree here quite honestly. Easy to play does not mean easy to enjoy. When you spend most of the first games getting shot at by accident (like I did and the folks I've taught), you'll quickly lose your 4 operatives especially if you're not just learning with other new folks. More often than not, folks are getting into the game in a pre-established community at their LGS where people will just be better at using the cover system.

Death Guard have 2 more models and are much more forgiving with their 5+ FNP. While I understand the point is to onboard folks into the game and not hand them Phobos or Wyrmblade right away (as you mentioned), 4 Custodes feels like a trap that can bully folks out of the game. Custodes aren't winning tournaments because they're easy to win with neccessarily. I just worry that 4 Custodes might boom players faster than another easy team due to their highly prized models (which new players will lose faster).

Despite this feedback, I'm really happy to see more opinions on Kill Team out on the internet. No matter what folks think, the more content and conversations we have out in the wild for folks to interact with means the more folks thinking about the game and propelling it forward. Having just one YouTube video or Goonhammer article with a take on a topic like this doesn't help new players - this does, though.",NickNightrader,1686611684.0

mullvadvpn,"If you're trying to seed, not having port forwarding doesn't make seeding impossible, it just makes it a lot harder since you cannot connect to closed port peers, only open port peers. So, it's highly recommended you have it. 

If you don't care about seeding (though you should, since p2p relies on it), then you wouldn't really need to bother with it.

It's still sad thinking about Mullvad dropping port forwarding, I was a user of Mullvad for about 2 years. I swapped to AirVPN at first, but refunded and swapped over to ProtonVPN for port forwarding since AirVPN doesn't have a big server network and I'd often start with fast speeds and then go to a crawl due to the low infrastructure.

I was living in Japan in 2008, and remember when I first saw Hakuouki on the shelves.  Didn't actually buy it at that time because... honestly I went to that game shop a lot and was kind of familiar with the clerks there and didn't want them to think I was into stuff Like That. (Ahh, the follies of youth.  When you get closer to 40 you slowly start to lose the ability to feel shame.)  However, when I was a couple weeks from moving out of Japan I finally decided to get it!  I went to the game shop and... it wasn't in stock.  That was the end of that. (Kind of sad honestly I bet I would have loved it since at the time my favorite manga was Kaze Hikaru.)  I just kind of forgot about otome games after that.

I started playing them for real in 2020, and I'm still not entirely sure what led me to it.  Partially because I loved Mass Effect and just wanted more romance in my games like that.  Partially because I wanted to make a romance game of my own and wanted to see what else was out there (as research.)  However, I've kind of concluded there were two main things involved in it.  One, I was really deep into Granblue and had seen a comment from some ass on reddit saying that women need to stop asking for guys in the game since the game was for men only and girls should just go play ""fucking otome games or whatever.""  This annoyed me greatly of course but I guess it planted a seed somewhere in my head because a week later I saw Hakuouki for sale on PC and I thought ""It's on PC??????"" and also ""Wait maybe I should finally do the thing I wanted to do *twelve years ago*.""  It's just been a downhill slide since then.

My understanding is the community hasn't found the kernel hook to pull it off yet on Tensor kernels.

As I'm kind of discussing with devs in real time, I believe Tensor can do it, because Pixel stock firmware has a ""limit charging mode"" that kicks in and holds charge at 80% after four days of being persistently plugged in.

For Qualcomm devices, this is one of the biggest feature adds since LineageOS debuted. It may pressure Google to finally make hold charging a mandatory CDD feature. This is why LineageOS is so important as a bulkhead of the AOSP community.",chrisprice,1686596297.0

PropagandaPosters,"Obviously there is no reason to generalize on every priest, because it would be misguided by me, but let's put things clear here.

First, the entirety of the church had given their explicit endorsement of the Tsar and any action he did, so by logic they endorsed anything done in his name, so by association they all at least gave defense to pogroms and the autocratic regime (not very different from what the church was doing in many other monarchies in history, and that was a reason for both Liberals and Socialists to burn churches and kill priests).

Second, even if that hadn't been the case, which given how the Russian Orthodox church worked, it was, that wouldn't take away the fact that an overwhelming majority supported both absolutism, the black hundreds and the pogroms, to put an example on similar things on democratic regimes, not every soldier here in Argentina supported the dictatorship, but our constitution explicitely says that it doesn't matter, that the ""I was just following orders"" defense doesn't matter and if you took part on the regime you can be jailed.

SiegeAcademy,"The only key-binds I recommend changing are:

Swap walk and prone around; walk on ctrl and prone on alt. 

Reason being, you are only going to be either running or walking at one time, and the pinky is easiest to hit these two with. 

Prone on alt reduces the old accidental prone, and I like to be able to hit crouch (on C) and prone with my thumb. 

I don‚Äôt recommend changing lean binds, and avoid putting anything you regularly use on your mouse buttons. The reason for that is switching your grip to hit the buttons can affect your aim. The worst thing you can do imo is put your lean buttons on your mouse. I have my first mouse button as secondary gadget and second as ping. 

I have also altered some of the camera and drone binds to make them a little easier to hit without stretching my hand. Doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay but just makes things a little more convenient so I‚Äôd recommend it.",mattycmckee,1686593997.0

lepin,"Sounds sketchy imo. That use to be a popular excuse given to buyers when sellers had never sent it out in the first place. It doesnt happen so much any more because sellers arent that bad anymore, and their supply chains are much more reliable. I guess a few still exist like that.

Its used to buy more time until they do send it (some sellers dont actually have all sets in inventory at all times and order from distributor when they sell one), or when they just didnt send it all all due to laziness or error.

Tracking will almost alwats update eventually if it has been sent. Even the worst of them. No updated tracking means the number never got used outside if being issued once to appease the AliExpress system. 

Imo, if your tracking doesnt update within a week, and shown as moving around, I would contact them and tell them you are filing a dispute for goods not received. That usually lights a fire and they will either make sure it gets sent, or cancel the order if they are still stalling.

Also, if this is an AE seller, make sure you keep an eye on the dispute window to file. Once you are outside of that you cant do anything and the seller gets to keep your money whether you received it or not. Some sketchy sellers will try to string you along until its too late to file a dispute. Sticking to high %rated sellers minimizes this risk (97%+).

Good luck to you!",Metron_Seijin,1686595926.0
asianamerican,"It's a difficult balancing act imo. While you are right that he often plays into asian stereotypes, he's also short and ""funny"" so his options are limited in what roles he can get. The issue isn't with him imo, but with Hollywood broadly. In an ideal world, jimmy can play those stereotypical roles because there are tall good looking asian actors also getting equally many jobs. Then when jimmy does his thing, it's not a typical Chinese immigrant, but a nuanced character from China. I just don't like the idea of saying he's not allowed to work because he's short and not the best looking guy.

ThatsInsane,"You and I both know that ""emulation"" is only one aspect of the artistic process. You and I both know that even though trends and aesthetics are recycled, each cycle puts a unique and conscious spin on the reused concepts to adapt it for a contemporary audience.

You and I both know this because we're both adults. 

Let me try to explain what I mean with an analogy: remember the early 2000s? Imagine if we had a perfect AI movie maker in the early 2000s. Now imagine we've had it for a few decades, and because of that no one's made any movies, shows, books, even commercials since the AI became prominent in 1965. Everything after that has been AI generated. If you want you can imagine an alien gave us this AI or something. 
Now I want you to honestly consider if you would have been content watching infinite variable content emulated entirely from films/books/TV made at least 35 years ago. It's all new, there's variety, there's novelty, they've even worked modern slang into the dialogue. But the lives the characters lead, the cinematic styles employed, the plots, the values and morals are all emulations of what was popular when your parents were small children, if not emulations of things that were popular before they were born.

And the truth is unless you're doing summer vacation in philly, you won't be on 95 there. 95 runs straight through the city, NJTP, 276, and to a lesser extent 295 all form a proto-ring road around the city. The vast majority of non-PA bound traffic will be taking the NJTP anyway, that's actually the main artery northbound in this one area. In all honesty, it's probably the single best part of 95 for this to happen to on the entire NY-DC stretch.

And the effect is exactly what you would expect given this situation - surface road traffic is a lot higher (because this stretch of 95 is mostly used by locals) but the actual highway traffic hasn't been too bad. Took about an extra 10 minutes for my friend to get from north Philly to NJ this morning for work. 295 and NJTP had the standard amount of traffic around rush hour.

I don't have Borderlands 3, but I have used CE on Borderlands 2. 
if you change your badass points, it affects all characters. if you just change the unlocked inventory slot or level, that only affects the character you are using. Ammo wise should also only affect your character as you aren't transferring weapons between characters.

If you're asking about if you use CE will it affect other players in your game in a co-op game, then it depends on what you're doing. generally anything you do to your character doesn't always affect other players. a lot of the time, you have to be the host to make some cheats able to work, like infinite slot machine and stuff like that.

If you want everything to turn back to vanilla, you can try reverting all the changes you made manually, or start a new character. I'm not entirely sure if there is another way.

StardewValleyExpanded,"Never used the mod, but taking a look at its files, it seems she doesn't.  She only leaves the house once per week, and that's to visit Emily. If you want her to work at her shop, you'll have to edit her schedule.

Go to the mod folder, into [CP] Looking for Love\assets\Sandy and open Sandy.json.

Search for 

    ""Target"": ""Characters/schedules/Sandy""

You can type in whatever you want to change her schedule to in the Entries section.  So if you want her to head to work each day except Sunday at 10:00 AM and to head home at 6:00 PM, for example, then put these in before the marriage_Sun line (don't know if they actually *need* to go before, just each file that I checked for reference lists Sunday as the last day):

    ""marriage_Mon"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Tue"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Wed"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Thu"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Fri"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",
    ""marriage_Sat"": ""1000 SandyHouse 2 5 2/1800 BusStop -1 23 3"",

I think that should work. Just make sure you don't miss the commas.  And change the times to whatever you want them to be. If the mod adds lines for her to say on days she stays at home, you might want to remove a day or two from that list so you can see that dialogue (I didn't look too carefully at what all was added for her.)",korrin-,1686610639.0

Fedora,"> ""Mess up my workflow"" makes no real sense.

Well sorry, I misspoke. What I really meant was using a Firefox dev edition flatpak will prevent me from being able to access local projects, as it blocks access to home directory by default. Of course I can fix this, but my preference for everything is always RPMs first, flatpaks second, especially because I refuse to use flathub.

> COPR packages are 3rd party. If they compile well, Fedora can discuss to make them official. This happened with waydroid.

That's very nice to know that there is a pipeline available like this.

> And yes, avoid when possible. Its an external system repo, system upgrades may fail, they are less secure, may cause dependency errors and they are very insecure compared to just flatpaks.

Maybe she's somehow learned the (wrong) belief that she shouldn't expect to enjoy sex and it's something to give to men rather than something inherently enjoyable for both parties under the right circumstances. I completely disagree that she's trying to manipulate you in some way.  She definitely has some things she needs to work through. Given that sexual attraction is important to you (and most people), I  don't think you should continue the relationship, but maybe out of kindness suggest she looks for someone who she is actually attracted to.",Interestedmillennial,1686618189.0

Je peux accepter une ¬´¬†tourn√©e¬†¬ª mais je prends la deuxi√®me s‚Äôil y en a une. 
Avec mon copain, on a gard√© ce genre de rythme sans se prendre la t√™te : un coup c‚Äôest l‚Äôun qui paye, apr√®s l‚Äôautre, parfois on divise. C‚Äôest rare que l‚Äôun ou l‚Äôautre soit enti√®rement invit√© surtout quand on fait une sortie ch√®re (on chipote pas pour un verre ou un kebab quoi). Bien s√ªr c‚Äôest diff√©rent pour les anniversaires ou c√©l√©bration
Je trouve que √ßa permet d‚Äô√™tre plus en phase avec la personne car on se met sur un pied d‚Äô√©galit√©, il n‚Äôy a pas d‚Äôattente vis √† vis de l‚Äôautre par rapport √† √ßa. On choisit tous les deux quelque chose qui convient √† nos budgets respectifs et il n‚Äôy a pas de mauvaise surprise
D‚Äôun point de vue ¬´¬†f√©ministe¬†¬ª, je pense que ce genre de galanterie entretien le clich√© d‚Äôune femme sans ressource qui a besoin d‚Äôun homme pour vivre et cela me d√©range. M√™me si j‚Äôentends l‚Äôargument des diff√©rences de salaires ou de t√¢ches m√©nag√®res, qui fait que les femmes sont davantage exploit√©es par le patriarcat et que donc le patriarcat leur doit bien un date gratuit, je pense que c‚Äôest justement l‚Äôinverse qui se produit : accepter que c‚Äôest √† l‚Äôhomme de payer, c‚Äôest accepter les r√¥les conf√©r√©s par le patriarcat de l‚Äôhomme qui entretient la femme.
Si l‚Äô√©galit√© n‚Äôest pas synonyme d‚Äô√©quit√©, le combat n‚Äôest pour moi pas l√†, mais bien au del√† de la simple question du ¬´¬†c‚Äôest √† l‚Äôhomme de r√©gler l‚Äôaddition¬†¬ª. C‚Äôest plus : pourquoi les hommes se sentent oblig√©s d‚Äôinviter les femmes et les femmes d‚Äôaccepter les invitations ? Pourquoi est-ce qu‚Äôon am√®ne plus facilement l‚Äôaddition √† l‚Äôhomme plut√¥t qu‚Äô√† la femme ? Et surtout : cela est-il toujours pertinent de nos jours ?
De mani√®re g√©n√©rale les femmes travaillent. Elles peuvent se payer seules leurs sorties et leurs consommation. Penser que c‚Äôest √† l‚Äôhomme de payer, c‚Äôest accepter une nouvelle soumission de la femme face √† l‚Äôhomme",Inevitable-Piglet469,1686611469.0

A high turnover of people coming and going every 3 months, and event more alarming, management would not notify or give any reasons as to why people left and if there are plans to fill in their roles in the future.

Work-life balance was a phrased that was looked down upon. People were expected to reply to any requests, no matter how minor, within a matter of minutes even on weekends. With all the extra time I had spent on work during nights and weekends actually felt like taking a pay cut for me, instead of having a decent wage.

Colleagues would get questioned or berated for simplest mistakes publicly. Often in group chats with clients present.

On a down low, a preference was given to interviewees who were single/unattached so that quote ‚Äúthey wouldn‚Äôt have any family to date at them from work‚Äù.

A lot of people on there are not professional sellers so it just makes way more sense to reuse packaging instead of investing in new packaging for their miniscule number of orders.

If I read a review like that I'd go to the buyer who rated that way and proactively block them so they couldn't purchase from me, as they would be disappointed. Lol 

And I would definitely not let that type of review stop me from purchasing from you. There's nothing wrong with reusing packages. Besides, it is better for the environment than using new ones every time. 

Most people will at least look at what the bad ratings are saying before they make a judgment call whether to listen to them. You could also, if you want to be proactive yourself about it, put a note in your bio that you got a poor rating due to reusing an amazon package for an order. Just be upfront about it.

Bitwarden,"Were these SUCCESSFUL logins, or were they?merely attempts? Look at the Bitwarden messages carefully. 

If they were just attempts, you are likely being targeted by one or more credential stuffing attacks. Make sure you have a strong master password (five or more words in a randomly generated passphrase). Make sure you have good 2FA (TOTP or FIDO2/WebAuthn). 

And consider updating your vault to have a different email. Many of us have a second email that is used for Bitwarden and little or nothing else‚Äîbut there is still an app on our phone to ping us of alerts like this. 

If otoh these were successful logins,  then hoo-wee, you have your work cut out. First, you need to figure out how it happened, so you don't just end up here again.  One or more of the devices you have accessed your vault from have been compromised. 

You should only use your vault on a device that you fully trust, and it should never be accessible by others. You should have full knowledge and control of the installed apps, no questionable apps or plugins,  yada yada good opsec.

If you can't find the malware on any of your devices,  you will need to do a full system restore,  including reformatting your disk, of every system you have Bitwarden installed.  Otherwise you risk ending up here again. 

After (and ONLY after) you have a clean device, you also need to clean up your vault. You need to change your master password (be sure to write down the new one), and rotate the encryption key. (This is a good time to switch your KDF to Argon2 if you haven't already.)

Next, you will need to change EVERY password in your vault.  Start with the most important ones, but you will need to change them all. Similarly, if you have a TOTP app on the compromised device (Bitwarden Authenticator or anything else for that matter), you need to rotate the TOTP key as well.

audio,">Why is DSP important ? Is it mandatory for good audio ?

Yes and no. The headphone frequency response is not going to be perfect. You can fix some of that with DSP. In that DSP there is for ex. a 10 channel parametric equalizer that can be used to smooth over the biggest peaks. You need seriously expensive headphones to match DSP corrected ""regular"" headphones, and even then.. the expensive headphones will sound even better with proper correction curve.

Unfortunately, those who want DSPs for headphones don't shy away from high prices but there might be something in the professional audio side.. [https://www.thomann.de/gb/presonus\_revelator\_io24.htm](https://www.thomann.de/gb/presonus_revelator_io24.htm)

But of course, you could just buy 40$ USB audio interface and use Equalizer APO... It can process all windows audio, takes 1% of CPU with low latency.. and is free. That is what i use for audio processing, it is installed in every computer, along with LoudMax limiter (evens out level changes, handy for youtube, TV and movies.. no more quiet dialogue and earth shattering explosions..)..

The second part of the quote, ""Soon everything will have forgotten you,"" is a reminder that our time on Earth is limited. We will all eventually die, and when we do, our physical bodies will decompose and our memories will be lost. This may seem like a depressing thought, but it can also be liberating.

As for Ben... I gotta say he doesn't do a lot for me to like him as a character. I side with him being disgusted and off put by Misty's advances, I understand his rejection of the cannibalism the group has resorted to, and I even get why he would want to burn down the cabin with the entire team inside it. But I don't find him compelling. I liked his bond with Natalie, but it was not explored enough for me to really care about the guy.

There would definitely be some international backlash from SJH fans, but for the show to be cancelled? Naw. 

I think RM should take the risk and do it. And introduce a new female member to the cast. There are so many good replacements and many celebrities would die for the opportunity (think Kang Hanna, Lee Dahee, etc... ) This would also revamp the program and entice more viewers. 

I also want to state that I don't hate Jihyo as a person. I recognize she is a kind individual, as we heard about her paying her staff's wages due to agency issues. But that's her persona outside of work. Beyond that, I'm just highly critical of her role in RM.

So its not so much that theyre closed up but their social meter is pretty full id say. Why would you make new friends when you already have plans every weekend, easter, midsommar etc. Add to that the occasional birthday. It gets trickier and trickier as people grow older. BUT because of this the internationals really do stick together. Ive been living in scandinavia for 7 years and none of my close friends are scandi of any sort. I used to think it was a problem and was truly torn about it. But after learning the language, marrying a scandi and paying taxes for all these years i feel like ive done enough to integrate. my friends will forever be expats and thats ok.",forgetitok,1686611651.0

macbook,"Copy & pasted comment from someone else who just asked me this today:

&#x200B;

A quick google search says macbooks last on average 7 years.  
My dad & a friend of mine both have early 2015 macbook pro's though that they both got in 2015 and they have never had one issue with them at all...ever. So theirs have lasted 8 years so far with not one issue ever, and they're both still kickin and working flawlessly.  
My dad has 100K in his bank account and refuses to upgrade his 2015 macbook even though I keep trying to get him to do it. But even his 2015 is perfectly fine for web browsing, basic tasks and paying bills and that's all he does on it, so it still works great for basic stuff.  
When to upgrade really depends on your budget and what you want out of your laptop. So long story short, if you get a macbook it will almost certainly last you a very very very long time. Probably somewhere in the range of 6 to 8 years (or more) easy if you take care of it.  
And you only need to upgrade it if you have the budget to and/or if you want whatever added little features new macbooks may end up coming with. If not, many many people just ride it out with old macbooks. Old macboks are the old honda civics of the computer world. They last forever, they usually have 0 issues if you take care of them and they're reliable af.  
I bought an M1 14 Pro last month and I have no idea how long this thing will last me, probably a very very long time because this thing is super mega overkill for what I do on my laptop. So I'm expecting to get minimum 4 to 5 years out of it very easily, and that's over top of the fact that it's already a 2 year old laptop. And that's also even being someone who wants a top of the line laptop at all times. But this thing will probably be top of the line for that long, as far as a basic tasks laptop goes.",SimplyHobbit,1686622953.0

mariokart,"I'm still a big fan of Wii U Rainbow Road, but for me it was just a bit underwhelming. The new mechanic of anti gravity completely revolutionized how courses are designed. For example, Bowser's Castle has you driving all over the walls, on the ceiling across from other racers on a different path, and the giant lava Bowser punching the course looked INCREDIBLE. Easily the best Bowser's Castle of all time. So many other courses utilize anti gravity to create incredible paths and designs that interact with the world around you, like Mario Kart Stadium, Water Park, Mario Circuit, Shy Guy Falls, Electrodrome, Dragon Driftway, Big Blue, and even N64 Rainbow Road. Rainbow Road on the other hand barely uses the anti gravity in a way that affects the course, and it's almost like I wanted the course to have the most anti gravity antics and to be incredibly difficult, but it just isn't.

I will also say that \[even though this wasn't around in 2014\], the way courses are designed in the booster course pass, specifically with courses having drastically altered paths between each lap (besides just Mount Wario, N64 Rainbow Road, and Big Blue), it feels like they could have done so much more. Just imagine a course with a crazy path like Sydney Sprint or Singapore Speedway, combined with a course with some ridiculous anti gravity shenanigans like Dragon Driftway, and then make it a Rainbow Road course and amp the difficulty up to 11.

They *don't* choose to.  They require intelligent, sapient brains for both reproduction and nourishment.  They closest they've come to breaking that is in Spelljammer, where they've selectively bred a race with an incredible *potential* for Intellect but no ability to use it (i.e, lobotomised gnomes), which they keep like cattle so as not to have to eat the brains of the races they trade with.

MHRise,"I love that Capcom has listened to virtually everything the community asked for throughout Rise's lifespan. It feels like we built the game along with them! That said.... the difficulty spike in Rise:Sunbreak has made it evident to me that there is such thing as listening TOO MUCH to the playerbase. TU3 is where I feel things started getting ridiculous.

Now, I see myself as a fine enough and competent huntress. There's not a single monster that I can't take on by myself. HOWEVER, there are numerous times in these late update hunts where I have to play at my A-Game, lest I triple cart. Now, I dont have an issue with hunts being hard.....

What I DO have an issue with is when I'm frustrated by these monsters and people like Elitists, Meta Slaves or Masochists STILL say ""hurr durr, still too easy!"" Don't get me started on the people who complain are also the ones that triple cart and make me facepalm saying ""Still think it's too easy?""

Like, at what point do you consider something difficult?! Do you want the game to be IMPOSSIBLE?! Do you always want to be near the point where you commit property damage via Controller Boomerang?!

....Im just gonna say it. I find World:IB easier. The only monster I know I cant beat alone (YET) is Fatalis. Whenever I return from a hiatus from the game, I fire up Raging Brachydios. He never carts me. He is, as I boast, my b*tch. And I play Dual Blades, a weapon I've been told is a bad matchup against Raging Brachydios.

I dont have this same mentality in R:SB. Despite my proficiency with my weapon, increased mobility and power of Wirebugs, one wrong move and that could be a cart.

I love Rise:Sunbreak. Its my favorite game, period. But I have a negative opinion towards all the players who did, AND STILL say the game is too easy. Because I just understand what they consider ""difficult...""",RukiaShikon,1686625075.0

 All that is to say that at some point something went wrong with the Chiefs mess and it's now rearing its ugly head after years of being below the surface. 

I'm not going to drone on about the Fraternity-like mindset of the Mess but will instead point out that Chiefs have lost the drive to do right by their Sailors. They have done this because they have been trained to be risk adverse, with respect to how their actions will affect their career. That thinking has led them to become the Front Line Enforcers, not FL Managers/Mentors. 

That young Sailor sounds like a person who has been made to respect Chiefs out of fear. I see it at my own command and it's similar to the signs of domestic abuse (which I unfortunately have too much personal experience with).

""Sometimes, it can happen like that. Yeah, conditions in England are a lot different to what Indian cricket has been playing in. Sometimes that happens that way, it's called that bit of dressing room pressure,'' said McGrath.

''Both teams haven't played a lot of Test cricket lately but that's the way it goes.

whatsthisrock,"This is coarse-grained fayalitic slag.  Stony meteorites are mostly finely granular chondrites that look nothing like this, and iron meteorites are usually solid Fe-Ni, with some inclusions.  This website has a decent collection of of photos showing fresh and weathered meteorites of different types.  

https://meteoritegallery.com/what-do-meteorites-look-like/

There's nothing remotely like the funky ~honeycomb visible on your piece here - I'm not sure how it formed, but it doesn't resemble any features on known meteorites.  

This looks to be a melted mixture of silicates and metal that was poured out and allowed to cool as a sheet.  That's why you have distinct top and bottom textures and then smoother broken sides.

Police is gonna ask you to come to 3 marriage counseling and after that case will be registered. Once case is registered, she's gonna tell how much you are demanding for dowry and how much is it gonna settle. You'd need a good lawyer to settle things and bargain the settlement. Whatever they demand, start with 10% of it and say that's your limit. You're gonna probably pay 50-60% of what she asks. Lawyer is gonna eat some commision so be prepared for all these.

Let‚Äôs say you have an expense of $1,000. You can write that off, but all it does is save you the *tax*. So if your marginal tax rate is 25%, then it saves you $250 ($1,000 x 25%). However, it‚Äôs still better to not have an expense at all because the total money out of your pocket will still be $750 ($1,000 for the expense minus the $250 you saved with the offsetting tax due).

Would you rather pay $1,000 to save $250 at the end of the year or pay $0 right now and save $0 at the end of the year? Obviously pay $0 and save $0. Nobody should ever pay $1,000 to save $250 since it‚Äôs a net loss of $750.",Savior89,1686629888.0

CompanyOfHeroes,"Yeah snipers are fucking cancer. I've played so many games where I'll just outplay the shit out of someone all game, and then without fail theyll just start spamming snipers, and by the time I start doing the same I'm already two or three snipers behind and it's basically just game at that point because tiny axis squads are particularly weak to it. Countersniping is basically impossible until theyve already wiped half your army because because they recloak faster than you can countersnipe them until their like their third or fourth snipe, and all this time youre not even able to use your sniper against their infantry because if you reveal it you wont get a chance to countersnipe at all, AND there's a not insignificant chance your countersnipe will miss if you actually manage to get a shot off.

Anyone telling you bikes, jeeps, etc are the counter to them is just a shit player. Those units are worthless for chasing down snipers beyond the first 5 minutes. Snipers are gamebreaking, there is no viable way to deal with them beyond having your own snipers. Literally the only time sniper spam isnt the mark of a shit player is for dealing with brits, or countering other snipers.



One thing I REALLY liked about coh3 was how they gimped snipers to basically not scale at all with numbers. If you make a blob of snipers and A move across the map theyll constantly do ineffective things like all fire at the same target. If I woke up a billionaire one day and could go and buy relic, the first thing I'd do as lead of making a coh1 remake would be to implement that. Then make them do half damage to elite armor units, and make their accuracy affected by cover too for good measure.",Horror-Swan5132,1686625050.0

 A good trick for oddly angled situations is if you have a plane at an arbitrary angle, and you want to align an object to it, you can select the object in question, then shift select the plane, go to modify > match transformations > match rotation, this will (unless you've frozen transforms or something) align it to the rotation of that plane. Now if you switch your translate tool to object space you can now translate it in relation to the plane (technically to the local space of the object but since we matched transforms those are effectively identical)

Another thing you can do, and this helps when animating rigs with wonky orientations is to hit d, then rotate the pivot the where its oriented how you like, then go to modify > bake pivots. This gives you the benefit of fixing orientation problems in the middle of animating and it should fix your curves on the graph editor to match.

You can also set the pivot to match any edge on any object by going into the tool settings panel (with one of the transform tools, trans rot or scale, active) and hitting edit pivot and selecting an edge.

Why do you have to ask this???? It's too freaking hard to answer it.

To be honest, the one that i love the most, whatever is a BL or not is still Utsukushii Kare. This series changed me for better. As crazy as it sounds it had a big influence in my life.

It's really hard to chose only one of them because i have my favorite from each genre, whatever is BL or not.

From fantasy/ survival kind of setting, i love Alice in Borderland, Kingdom, Rurouni  Kenshin, The end of the world with me, Assassination classroom, Tokyo Ghoul etc

From the light shoujo or shounen ai adaptations, i loved Heroine disqualified, The black devil and the white prince, Daytime shooting star, Kieta Hatsukoi etc.

From the crime genre, i loved  the Cold case series, Unnatural, and many others. The day Japan will make a BL set in the  crime/mystery setting i will go overboard hahhahaü§£üòÇ. This is my favorite genre among all the other genres in general.

My latest favorite from the non- BL series is Silent",smittenkittyyan,1686631143.0

Keep in mind that their income may not have gone up that much.

stupidpol,"As far as I understand it through historical literature, the claim that Queen Charlotte was black is very recent - I believe it originated in 1920s Germany, was explored further by West Indian historians in the 1940s (Jamaican author Joel Augustus Rogers made that conclusion), and then was expounded *further* by the historian Mario de Valdes y Cocom in... 1997 or 1998? I forget. But it was from there that it has sprung up to become something that people state with almost certainty.

As far as I understand the scholarship, however, the purported ancestor of Queen Charlotte that her being black would stem from was named [Margarita de Castro e Sousa, herself being descended from a woman named Madragana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Margarita_de_Castro_e_Souza_genealogy_and_descent.JPG) who was a mistress of King Alfonso III of Portugal. The assertion that this ancestor was black comes from a misunderstanding regarding the terminology behind what she *was.* It is likely that Madragana was not of sub-Saharan African descent, but was either Moorish (who were themselves predominantly Berber - remember that in the Middle Ages, to call someone 'black' was not inherently racial, but was an assigned term of morality or purity - even white Europeans, such as pagan Lithuanians, could be 'black') or Mozarab (Latin Christians under Islamic rule). It's difficult to know which she was, and although it's not impossible that perhaps Madragana was of sub-Saharan ancestry, it's not necessarily *likely*.

Even if she *did* have an ancestor of sub-Saharan ethnicity or race... It would not be likely to show up *that* far down the line - five centuries after the period in which Madragana lived!

All of this illustrates a greater problem with how identity politics and racial aesthetics are examined by the general public, more susceptible to pop history than to academic history (which is a problem with the academy and with how popular history is conveyed, too - different discussion entirely). There exists a willingness to latch on to something after the fact and retroactively change historical perception to fit a particular sociocultural narrative and the desire to do *something*, but not do so much as to change their own comfort or effect real material change. Historical fantasy allows an outlet to create or rewrite characters in alternate histories and create a retroactive narrative of progressivism without reflecting on present material reality. Portraying a quantity of the upper classes of Great Britain as black in the 18th century doesn't better the on-the-ground realuty for Black Britons or African Americans, but it gives the illusion of a vision of progress which did not exist then, but which they can feel good about portraying now as it portrays a pure meritocracy - it is pandering to some degree and there is a distinct target audience.

As a historian, portrayals such as *Bridgerton* don't *inherently* bother me for their substance as I recognise them for what they are (controversial portrayals such as Cleopatra being sub-Saharan African bother me more for different reasons), but I find myself wanting to or having to explain - when asked - the truthful history to those people I know who are fans of such works more often than not, and I wish more effort was taken to preserve historical accuracy and tell interesting historical stories with characters of all ethnicities and races.",Polskers,1686632001.0

The rear brake service seems odd; unless they're actually worn out, why would they change them? The fronts will go before the rears, so unless you've had the front brakes done, brake hard a lot or live on a mountain, the rears should last for quite a while still. Unless the pads are worn out, smells like bullshit. 

Fuel injection service should not be needed unless there is an actual issue. I have a 17 year old volvo that I recently had to pull the injectors out of. They were in perfect condition at 140k miles. 

The CVT service looks fishy. They're not stating that they're changing the fluid anywhere, just ""performing service"". I cannot find any information about a need for fluid conditioner (no idea why it would need it or what it even is). Yes, you should at one point change the CVT fluid, but it shows as part of Service D which is done at 5 years or 60k miles. Same with diff oil, done during service D.

OnlyFansReviews,"Your request post has joined the moderating queue and will be evaluated for manual approval by mods. If your post does not get approved within the next 24 hours it is because it has not followed the request post guideline. You can read the guideline below, if you feel your post does not follow our guideline please delete it and repost. 

Request posts are for finding a specific ONLYFANS page and creator to SUBSCRIBE to. You can use request posts to find an onlyfans page that that offers specific content and aesthetics, genres and themes you are looking for.  

For example:  
*'I am looking for a busty  creator over 35 y/o who creates 'hot wife' content.'*  
*'I am looking for a creator with a nerdy aesthetic who uses bad dragon toys.'*  

The body of posts should go into more detail. You can include things such as budget, what kind of video content you would like available on their page or tip-able services and deal breakers.  

Requests are NOT for recruiting any nsfw creator/ seller to give you GFE, video call, sexting, someone nice to be your friend, someone to make a custom for you. This negates the point of making a request when you consider that nearly every onlyfans creator offers these services as tip-able extras on their page. Your request should primarily reference the on the feed content a creator is making or a creator with a specific look and style.  

Things you absolutely cannot request:  
- Someone just to chat to.  
- A new or 'small' creator.  
- Custom content/ sexting/ video calls. You may specify that you would like the onlyfans creator/ page you are requesting to have that as an option, but it shouldn't be the basis of your request.  
- Freebies of any kind including dms before subscribing, free content or previews that aren't already readily available on the creator's social media.  
- Taboo content, things that are against onlyfans guidelines. 
- Nothing that could compromise the creators safety or privacy should be requested.  
- Payment methods outside of onlyfans.  
- Budget that goes outside the [pricing guideline](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyFansReviews/comments/ukpora/pricing_guideline/). 

Example of requests that will be removed and poster banned:  
*'Looking for a small creator for girlfriend experience.'*  
*'Looking for a young creator to make a custom.'*

koreanvariety,"Ep 16 is the latest that is out on Netflix, but Netflix is about 4 eps behind Korea broadcast. Seems like OP is talking about Ep 16 but there are some typos and inaccuracies in what OP that feels odd.

- What OP specifically wrote was ""esp 16"", could be a typo of 'Eps 16' or could be referring to 16 starting lineup?

- Based on Ep 16, Lee Jang Gun, Lee Hyung Taik and Kim Jun Hyeon are out. But OP wrote Jun Hyeon twice and included Mo Tae Bum. OP also wrote that 2 previous captains are out. Only Hyung Taik who is a previous captain that is out. IIRC, Jang Gun and Tae Bum temporarily took over the captain's armband when the actual captain at that time was not on the field or if they subbed for the captain. But that doesn't make them count as ""previous captains"".

So I am not too sure if OP is specifically talking about Ep 16.

Anyway, back on your question on Jang Gun.

I believe the coaches are right about Jang Gun but more specifically when they say that he did not practice, they were saying that he did not practice to improve on his weak points. He is weak in ball-trapping and dribbling.

He could only have few self-practice per week (maybe 1 time per week) and in his practice, he could have drilled other stuff like shooting, crossing, long passes, etc. He probably spent little to no time on trapping and dribbling.

Techniques, especially trapping and dribbling can be improved tremendulously with practice before hitting the ""lack of talent"" wall. Kang Chilku and Lee Jihwan are  good examples. They had no experience with soccer prior to joining and you can see how much their ball control skills improved. So Jang Gun definitely did not practice on his weakness. If anything, Jang Gun has better athletism and physicality than Chilku and Jihwan. He is bigger, faster and stronger than them.

Another thing about Jang Gun is that he is a lazy player on the field. He only stays in his tiny area. He doesn't make runs, he doesn't create space, he has terrible vision on the field, he doesn't position himself well. Whereas Eun Gyu and Nam Kyu are constantly making space and drawing defenders out of position. They are as dangerous off the ball as they are on the ball. Game sense generally builds up slowly from playing games. Jang Gun's lack of game sense showed that he doesn't have enough practice games outside of filming the show.

The last thing is his mentality. When he loses the ball, he just lowers his head and sigh in frustration while standing still. Comparing to Chilku and Jihwan again, when they loses the ball, they immediately start chasing after it and start hounding the opponent. This is why they nicknamed Chilku the vacuum.

IMO Jang Gun completely deserves to be dropped from the 1st team.

Sidenote, does Jang Gun not play Kabbadi in the Indian league anymore? Life is back to normal in Korea and India in term of Covid restrictions, doesn't he need to go back to India for his main job?",shiningject,1686625912.0

The reason we have ""primal fears"" is because people who feared those things survived to breed, so it is ultimately an extension of the fear of death
2. I thought you were being metaphorical
3. Death is any life being lost, that being yours or others
4. one, just because those are the ones we are born with doesn't mean they're the root, those are just the first ones we have, and 2, why, pray tell, do we fear those things? Because people who avoided those things got to live long enough to breed
5. glad we agree.
6.  The first human didn't necessarily have it, you cannot prove that. It's possible whenever the first ""human"" (which really would of been a part of another species that had just crossed the line to become a ""human"", wherever you draw that line) had that fear, but it's also possible the conditions the first humans were in didn't result in them developing that fear.

Necrontyr,"I see this criticism come up a lot, and I can empathise - while the crusade following the Akrops into the ghostwind was always my intention, I decided to leave the mechanism by which this occurs deliberately opaque. It was a decision I made carefully, and I stand by it, but I can certainly see where it has left people confused!

I'm loathe to set any explanation in stone, since TDK is very much a story about subjectivity, and I want to leave people free to draw their own conclusions. With that said:

>!The Warlock did it. Or at least, the Warlock allowed it. !<

Am-heht is a being of terrifying power, and also an utter bastard, with their own hidden agenda regarding Oltyx, Mentep, and the entire matter of the Curse. Am-heht knew about the gold and the bones and such - they knew Oltyx would end up drawing his foes to him, and with their mastery of the ghostwind, it would have been no effort at all to simply ""leave the door open"" for the crusade after the Akrops went through. 

I've included three paragraphs from TDK: Reign below, which back up what I said about Am-heht - maybe that will help show where I was coming from. 

Like I say, I don't want to be too prescriptive. But ultimately, an author only gets one chance to tell a story, and if I left people scratching their heads then maybe I could have been clearer! 

At the end of the day, I really appreciate any criticism - it makes me better at what I do, after all, and it means people are reading my work, for which I'm damned grateful :) 

`This‚Ä¶ ghostwind,‚Äô Oltyx interrupted. ‚ÄòIs it some manner of drive? Or a`   
`place?‚Äô`  
`‚ÄòIt is both, and it is neither,‚Äô snapped Am-heht, with idle contempt. ‚ÄòYou`   
`could not understand its true nature. All you need know is this ‚Äì it will`   
`bring you to the circumstance of your testing.‚Äô`  


`---`

  
`‚ÄòI see,‚Äô said Oltyx, who did not see, and then set the butt of his glaive in`   
`the crust beside him with grim resolve. ‚ÄòIn which case, what is to be the`   
`price?‚Äô He considered Shabb once more, hunched in invisible agony at the`   
`edge of his visual field.`   
 `‚ÄòIt is of no cost to me, to return the knowledge of the ghostwind to`   
`Mentep. I have moved beyond such trinkets, now. So, I shall exact no price.`   
`Indeed, to impart this thing on my former disciple‚Ä¶ appeals to me. Perhaps the journey along the path it opens may be what revives the spirit of`   
`Mentep the Inscrutable. Perhaps, even, it will draw him to the resumption`   
`of his great works.‚Äô`  
`‚ÄòSo then, warlock,‚Äô said Oltyx, ‚Äòimpart it.‚Äô` 

`---`

  
`‚ÄòIt is done,‚Äô Am-heht pronounced. ‚ÄòAnd no, I will demand nothing from`   
`you in return, little king. Because this gift is for Mentep, in the end. But`   
`make no mistake, Oltyx of Ithakas ‚Äì whatever benefit you may derive from`   
`it, you will pay for in due time.‚Äô`  
`Oltyx stood dumbstruck on the slag, unsure whether he had just secured`   
`a great victory against all expectations, or sealed himself to a terrible fate.`   
`Perhaps both, and neither, he decided, eventually. He had no idea what had`   
`just happened. There were so many questions, and so few he dared to ask.`   
`But there were practical matters, at least, that he could not neglect.`  
`‚ÄòWill our pursuers be able to follow us, as we make use of this ghostwind?‚Äô`  
`‚ÄòNot if you do not will it to be so,‚Äô said the warlock, as if the answer should`   
`have been obvious. Oltyx did not feel in any way reassured, but refused to`   
`stumble over the cryptic answer.`",Nate_Crowley,1686633994.0

TrueAnon,"I should clarify that I'm in academia and most strikes are not centered around research workers but are instead focused on withholding grades and stopping various administrative tasks (hiring people, etc.). The actual ""rigorous and expensive labor"" still usually ends up being done, as we never seem to be able to scare grad students and postdocs away from maintaining lab work (they complain that they'll lose 2+ years of work, etc.). You don't really sound like you have a clear picture of how these things work. In particular, you don't seem to understand what I'm talking about with regards to ""the problems for the undergrads"".

Sorry, maybe I should have clarified that I'd love to have someone with experience doing labor organizing in this industry to chime in, as I don't ever really get to ask about the end goals of the labor initiatives I've been involved with in the past and they have ranged from terrible (some of the wrecker stuff mentioned elsewhere in here) to aimless (we withhold grades and stop responding to emails from the undergrads for another ? weeks and then ? will cause the administration to do what we want).

AskScienceDiscussion,">NASA is planning to build a permanent base on the moon.

With supplies from Earth and a regular rotation of personnel. It's also a hell of a long way off in the future.

>surely the hard vacuum of space, with temperatures fluctuating between 120C \~ -208C and fine, abrasive glass needles for dirt is a far more hostile environment than an asteroid could ever render the earth without turning the crust into magma right?

After a certain point, it is irrelevant to compare ""more hostile"". Once you reach a point where life is no longer supportable, you're really just quibbling. It's like arguing which is more deadly, Venus or Jupiter. You're dead within seconds either way so what does it matter?

To get back to your question, there are multiple ways an asteroid can render the Earth inhospitable without turning the crust to magma. All it has to do is trigger the right set of circumstances. In fact, it doesn't even take an asteroid. Several mass extinctions, including one that almost wiped us out not too long ago, happened as a result of events that happened on Earth itself.

>surely the threat of total planetwide extinction would warrant significantly higher budgets than scientific curiosity right?

And surely if you threw 9 women at pregnancy you could have a baby in a month, right?

If a K-T-type asteroid were heading for the planet, you could throw all the money in the world at it and there'd be no way to prevent it. And good luck trying to build shelters when the fundamental fabric of society breaks down in the absolute panic it would cause.

>surely it'll be much easier to construct things on the surface of the earth, where materials and equipment can rely on a worldwide network of trade and transport infrastructure that's existed since the very first cities, than it would be to fire them to the moon using enough fuel to accelerate it to mach 33.7 right?

You're missing the point. We don't have long-term self-sustaining shelters from something like a K-T asteroid. You're talking hundreds if not thousands of years depending on how things shake out. That's not a simple ""moon base"" type structure, nor could they be built on the scale to save billions of people.

And that would lead to panic and chaos. Governments would try to keep such a discovery quiet for as long as possible, but it wouldn't last long, especially in this day and age.

>this is the reason that i am of the opinion that a cataclysm needs to either be powerful enough to turn the earth into an asteroid belt, be without warning, or violate the laws of physics as we know it to render mankind extinct.

About 70,000 years ago humanity almost shuffled off this mortal coil due to drastic sudden climate change. You have FAR too much faith in our technology to sustain ourselves in anything but the climate we've been living in for the past few thousand years.

For example, the arable land that is capable of supporting the mass agricultural operations that feed the world makes up a very small percentage of the Earth's surface. A slight shift in the dominant climate patterns and all those arable lands become dust bowls.

Every society is three meals away from chaos.",Xyrus2000,1686543441.0

SBSE General Field Exam RA is very stressful and frankly the worst division in the IRS. There's a reason why there is so much turnover.

If you really want to stick to auditing, go with DCAA. Much better room for growth.

What each weapon brings and therefore what/how to counter that weapon is important. In basic terms, using a weapon with range against something like a short sword means not allowing opponents close that gap. That means knowing how to use footwork.

careerguidance,"You cannot lose money by making more money. That part is straightforward.

The higher tax rate is just barely complex enough to screw some people up a bit, but it really isn't complicated. For simplicity's sake, lets use fake numbers. Say you're in a 10% bracket but get bumped up to a 25% bracket when your paycheck hits $2000. At $2000 you pay $200 in tax. How much do you pay if you make $2100? $225. That's 10% of $2000 plus 25% of the last $100. Only the part that's above the cutoff gets taxed at the higher rate. 

Some folks just can't stand to pay their taxes. And it's true, when you see a bigger bite taken out it does kinda discourage overtime a bit. But you're damn sure not losing money doing it.

webhosting,"There is nothing to configure in your router.
Nginx receives requests for both domain names and then answers them using the site that matches from the configs server blocks.

If they are both hosted on the same machine then you don't need anything apart from a separate server bloc for each site. It's better to split the server blocks into their own config file.

This guide will get you going (one of the first results when searching).
https://tonyteaches.tech/nginx-multiple-sites/

The office docs are also helpful
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html

If the sites are on separate machines then you need one of them to proxy to the second (or a third machine to proxy to both). Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy with proxy_pass

You will also want each site to write error and access logs to their own files (as well as the master nginx logs), so you can see which messages are for which site easily.

You can also setup a default config to refuse a connection if someone tries to access via the IP address rather than a domain name

The series is impenetrable if you either don't have a legion of fans informing you the best way to go about X and Z or you ""get it"" from the start and it sinks its teeth into you. We have seen this literally in real time with the announcement of VI, how many influences have cried and cried until they saw X or Y video and ""discovered"" the tricks to Armored Core and now they get the fun.

AccidentalAlly,"Okay, so, my assumptions come from the fact that they say it's embedded in their religion to hate us.  Obviously it isn't EVERY Christian, but when it's every single one you talk to, with the exception of maybe one every month on average, you start to get an idea of how people probably feel about the person you are.  When every person you talk to of that religion, again, with the exception of once a month on average, says that trans people are grooming babies and then use their God to defend it, you start to get the idea that maybe the majority of people following the religion are just super hateful people.

However, you don't see trans people doing the things that they claim.  Drag Queens don't do the things they claim.  Gay people don't do the things they claim.  They just lie.  But when so many people share the experience of having religion be the justification for hating us on a legal level, you should sorta try to understand where people like me are coming from rather than licking the Christian boot and trying to appeal to them.  If you critically analyze what I said you might be able to deduce ""oh, this person has likely only had negative experiences with people of faith, with the way they talk about this.""

Why should I go high when they won't?

Oh, almost forgot; in America and most of the western world, Christianity dominates.  The majority of people one way or another believe in the Christian God.  At least, more people than their are gay people, or trans people.  With queer people being in the minority of people, and Christianity being the largest religion in the entire world, one generalization is more dangerous than the other.  The generalization of queer people being child groomers is FAR more harmful.  It has pushed anti-queer legislation in the United States.  It's the reason so many children are being denied hormone blockers, which are completely reversible.

Strange, isn't it, how saying that Christians are hateful doesn't introduce laws that make it so they can't practice their faith.  It doesn't make lawmakers outlaw their religion because i said ""on average they're miserable hateful people"".  It's almost like they're a protected group legally who use their legal protections to exert pressure on other groups with much LESS legal protections!

It's almost like that.",PLAGUE8163,1686637472.0

Dentistry,"Going to add my two cents on this one:

Yes, there is additional duplicated cost with multiple offices and yes, you may profit more from one well run practice vs two and decrease headaches. But‚Ä¶ you may also make much more in both practices vs one as well.

I have two offices and I can assure you, the addition of my second practice 3 years ago catapulted my income where my one private practice would not have allowed due to size. There is a certain great feeling knowing that while I am working at one office, another is making money for me. 

Is it stressful? Sure. Would I consolidate down to one practice? Maybe in the future, but not now.

It all depends on what you want out of your career.
Your 37 years of successful private practice sounds commendable and kuddos to you for it. Success is subjective however. So much goes into that like annual earnings, job satisfaction, patient outcomes, etc.

Speaking for myself, my reason for the multi practice approach was to eventually ease off the pedal and create something larger than myself. This will involve associates‚Ä¶ that is okay.

im using the ""vfio-pci.ids=**"" kernel parameter to load vfio stubs to the 1080, how ever I loose the ttys.

midnightsuns,"I cannot disagree more.

>!Sara thought she had her life all figured out. Be an immortal Blood, keep Chthon from infiltrating this world, hang out with your sister and fight demons. Pretty sweet gig.!<

>!But then it all started to go wrong.!<

>!First, the Salem coven reported a rising threat in the New World. We can assume that, despite their exceptional powers, Sara and Lilith were not omnipotent. They may not have known about the New World, or knew much about it. They did what seemed reasonable: have a moon seal to the coven to look after themselves. It didn‚Äôt work.!<

>!They don‚Äôt indicate how hard it was to move the Abbey from Transia to Massachusetts, but the implication is that it was difficult and extraordinary. Hiram Shaw was enough of danger to justify the move. He was so awful, so violent, so close to Chthon that Lilith tortured him to death.!<

>!And this is after she fell in love with a mortal! For two immortal sisters, it seems to have been as exceptional as the moving of the Abbey. This all must‚Äôve felt like too much for Sara. Once the plague came, took Gregor, and threatened Lilith‚Äôs baby, her betrayal must have felt like an eventuality. Somehow, after thousands of years Chthon had succeeded in turning her very own sister, a Blood!!<

>!But then Agatha appeared. Sara came to understand the sort of love that Lilith had experienced. Hunter may have been Sara‚Äôs last, best hope at thwarting Lilith and Chthon, but Agatha reminded her that she had become a caretaker. She was more than just an immortal Blood, she was an aunt and a life-partner. She had loved ones worth fighting for ‚Äî and dying for.!<

>!It worked, sort of. She did stop Lilith and Chthon, but it cost the life of the Hunter. In a sense, Sara failed as a caretaker, but that‚Äôs why we first meet her tending the flowers at Hunter‚Äôs resting place. Perhaps she could be a caretaker of Hunter in the afterlife.!<

>!Some years later, after reforming the Midnight Suns and fending off occasional problems, the unthinkable happened. The Scarlet Witch blew up Agatha, apparently trying to access the Elder Gods‚Äô temples or whatever. Maybe Agatha had egged her on, but the result was entirely Wanda‚Äôs fault. She lost control ‚Äî just as Sara and Agatha had feared would happen with Hunter so many years ago. Sending Wanda off to intern with the Sorcerer Supreme was an immense kindness to the girl who reckless got Agatha killed. The one person who made Sara better, softer, more open-hearted was dead.!<

>!To have Dr. Strange portal in one day, having failed to get the cooperation of Johnny Blaze, blathering on about Lilith, insisting that they reanimate the Hunter ‚Äî it all must‚Äôve been too much for Sara to handle. Sure, she‚Äôs an asshole. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong, and a gaggle of Avengers were intruding on her Abbey insisting that they needed the Hunter back. Fine. Reanimate them, get your Sanctum back, stop whatever bullshit Lilith has planned.!<

>!Except Lilith‚Äôs got a symbiote now that‚Äôs sort of immune to magic. And a couple of murderous goons with impressive skill sets. And eventually she snags the one man who knows how to use the one piece of technology capable of forging the only champion who can withstand the reforging of the Darkhold.!<

>!(This doesn‚Äôt even touch on Dracula‚Äôs bullshit!)!<

>!Yeah, Sara‚Äôs got some hard edges. She should. She‚Äôs seen some shit, and it seems like she‚Äôs the only one trying to keep this whole clown rodeo on track. Nico and Magik are going rogue. Stark and Strange are fixated on their own losses. Hunter invited fucking *DEADPOOL* to come live with them! But yeah, she‚Äôs the heartless bitch. It goes with the territory.

Reddit intends to begin charging exorbitant fees for API access starting June 19. If this plan is enacted, several third-party apps will be forced to shut down on June 30. They include Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Sync, and Redd Planet, among others. Third-party apps allow Reddit users to control and customize the ways that they view and interact with the platform, and allow Reddit‚Äôs volunteer moderators to perform their duties. 

Reddit‚Äôs decision to cash in on its API comes as the company is preparing to file for an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. Reddit profits from digital advertising, but Reddit has struggled to monetize its user base. 

Although Reddit launched way back in 2005, it didn't release its own app until 2016. For years, users had to rely on third-party apps -- these third-party apps helped Reddit grow its mobile user base. The official Reddit app is suboptimal in a number of ways but the most important are that it does not provide accessibility tools for visually impaired users and has less tools and functionality for moderation. Third-party apps offer their own aesthetic and features which are preferred by many users. 

Many subreddits are protesting in the form of a blackout beginning June 12. 

r/fragrance is suspending moderation, including automoderation, for the protest period. Posts and comments made during this time are unmoderated, as indicated by this comment.

r/fragrance moderators use third-party apps to moderate on mobile devices and understand that many users also prefer these apps. We encourage users to voice their concerns and support for third party apps to Reddit admin.

Saudi-US relation is several decades old. It has been really solid since Kissinger made a petro-dollar deal with Saudi. US provides Saudi with arms, rely on their oil, give support-protection to Saudi. And Saudi sells oil in dollar, support US in their military activities, buys billions of dollars worth US bonds. Arab block supported US during cold war since communists were anti religion. 

With all that said, things went exactly as you said. Democrats prioritized media-election points over US foreign policy. Trump repeatedly tried to keep US-KSA relation stable and ot was stable back then. Trump tried to avoid Khashoggi murder since it will cause problem in US-Saudi relations. 

But Democrats preferred to virtue signal with the murder. Btw, I'm not talking about actual justice, punishment for criminal. In international politics, justice is a fairy tale that no one cares about. Democrats intentionally destroyed the US-Saudi relations. Stopped sending weapons to Saudi. 

And now Saudi is afraid. They don't think of US as the stable ally they once thought them to be. Saudi is considering their relations with China, Russia.

Let‚Äôs put it this way: testing the RWD if you never drove an EV (or more precisely a Tesla) will give you a more natural progression.

In the US, where speed limits are low, superchargers are plentiful, and people cannot drive, the Model 3 RWD is more than ANY driver will ever need.

SPTarkov,"For SPT/EFT, you‚Äôre going to want to upgrade *both.*

That said, I‚Äôd probably upgrade the CPU *first*‚ÄîTarkov likes having a relatively large amount of on-die cache memory on the CPU compared to what you have. When it doesn‚Äôt have enough, the result is frequent frame drops/stuttering (i.e. you will drop from Frames Per Second to Seconds Per Frame, and it‚Äôll happen pretty much any time that bots think‚Äîon spawn, and on aggro).

The difficulty is that you‚Äôre on a first-Gen Ryzen processor, which means that you‚Äôre likely on a first-Gen Ryzen board. That means that the path to updating to a BIOS revision that supports Ryzen 5000 processors (if one even exists for your board) might require you to update the BIOS at least twice, and to use an intermediate CPU (e.g. Ryzen 2000/3000) for the final update (TLDR: AMD made too many AM4 CPUs, and it‚Äôs impossible for any single BIOS to support *all* of them). It‚Äôs also a problem because it‚Äôs not really worth sinking a lot of money into a new CPU for a board that old, given the realities of old boards (boards are a common failure point, and the feature sets of old boards are one of the things that pushes people to upgrade).

Overall, my specific recommendations, ranked from best to worst in terms of performance, are:

* AM5 board + 32GB DDR5 + 7800X3D
* AM5 board + 32GB DDR5 + 7600
* Used B550/X570 board + 32GB RAM + used 5600/5600X/5800X3D (but only if it‚Äôs priced attractively enough)
* Your current board + your current RAM + a used Ryzen 3000/5000 CPU.

#Do not ask for medical advice, and do not play doctor

What constitutes medical advice?
***

* ""What is this?"" 

 This is asking someone to diagnose the issue, and is medical advice.

* ""What should I do?""

This is asking someone to advise treatment, and is medical advice.

 * ""Should I go to the doctor?""

This is asking if you should seek treatment, and ergo, medical advice. 


**If you would ask the question of your doctor, it falls under this rule and not allowed. As a general rule, asking for medical advice from internet strangers is never a good idea. If you have questions regarding your condition, you are advised to contact your healthcare provider. If you are a medical provider, we would gently remind you that users are not patients, and you should not be offering medical advice to people who are not your patients.**

In Hara's Kingdom Zhao attacked first because Qin at this point was busy with their internal succession wars and gaining valuable lands from Han and Wei. EiSei couldn't attack Zhao because even he knew Zhao had nothing to offer for the expenses of such a war. Its historical fact that Qin attacked others based on value not just grudge. So while all others were playing border skirmishes Qin was smashing the golds and taking numbers. 

Even at Chouhei, RenPa understood he was fighting a losing war as Qin had 70 years advance on them, hence why he went for a walled trench war with direct orders to NOT FIGHT QIN on Open battlefield as the later beat them at everything from technological advances to logistics to the economy. His hope was that Qin would get bored waiting and focus on the other more valuable lands and forget about them. But his King was a dumbass and didn't get the message and thats what caused Chouhei, where Zhao lost not only any chance of winning but also their best general who had enough of Zhao stupidity and decided to retire to Wei. 

So had  Hara's RiBoku didn't barge in Qin's plan, Zhao would have ignored at least till either Han and or Wei fell. That's more years they could have used to restock, prepare better defenses or at least attempt to catch up between the power gaps between the 2 nations.

Guess what historical RiBoku's great plan that he is so famous for vs Qin involved? A repeat of RenPa's Wall trenches war with direct orders to not openly fight Qin in the fields? Its the reason why he is historically #4 in the 4 great generals of the era. Haruki is 1, RenPa is 2, OuSen is 3 then RiBoku.

phcareers,"Hi! 

With 5 years of my working experience, 2 years nakawfh till now. Introvert din ako at madalas ayoko din makainteract ng ibang tao. Having onsite experience is great as well pero preferred ko ang wfh.
Why?
1. Hindi ka magcocommute ‚ù§Ô∏è naranasan ko mag commute from rizal to makati for 2 months at yun ang pinaka nakakapagod.
2. You have your time(Not sure if same sa iba). My shift is 6am-3pm, wake up at 5am to time in and then sleep ulit. I can finish my workload for 4 hours and so.
3. Once out, out na. No one will message you after your shift. Sometimes they might pero you can reply the next day naman. 
4. Peaceful (kung trip mo na walang kausap, madalas wala talaga kakausap sayo)
5. For my team, they're the best. My manager and teammates are so responsive, and they will give you assistance, mag reach out ka lang.

The only ones who didn't get forcefully abducted from their own society are the Dwarves and, later on, some PoWs from the Holy Kingdom which, might I remind you, became PoWs and lost everything they had BECAUSE of Nazarick.

In the eyes of a Sorcerous Kingdom resident, he is not a ""benevolent ruler"", he is a god. People avoid him like the fucking plague because IF they offend him, they know they're as good as dead. The people who cannot avoid him always tip-toe around him like he's made of glass for the same exact reason.

PioneerMTG,"Not what you're asking for, but this is my opinion about Yorion in control shell: it's bad ^^ it really mess with the consistency of drawing your lands and/or important card for a given situation. 

Here is an example that illustrates that and made me aknowledge that Yorion isnt good in controlish deck : I'm the kind of kind who can't decide which card to cut when building a deck, because I want to play with all the cards I like, and for that, Yorion is the easy answer. 1 or 2 years ago, I built an Esper Doomforetold (in MTGA Historic), and played with it for almost a month, couldn't get past to diamond. I felt the problem of consistency, too many matches being manascrewed or not finding my key cards. I just tried the same list without Yorion and cutting the less impactful cards and got to Mythic in less than a week...

For me it's the same for UW control. Especially because the meta seems pretty fast (Mono W, the new Boros, Cheesefang, spirits, etc...), and in those matchups, you typically want to get your early removal cards, which will be harder to find in a diluted 80 cards deck. And besides that, I don't think Yorion gives you an edge in the mirror match or against mono G for instance. The only good reason to play it is against rakdos I'd say (which is relevant tho ahaha)

So that's it, sorry for not responding your initial question and for my English, but this was my take on Yorion.",Majjin_,1686644962.0
Skincare_Addiction,"Welcome to r/skincare_addiction! We'd like to take this time to remind you of a few things:

#Do not ask for medical advice, and do not play doctor

What constitutes medical advice?
***

* ""What is this?"" 

 This is asking someone to diagnose the issue, and is medical advice.

* ""What should I do?""

This is asking someone to advise treatment, and is medical advice.

 * ""Should I go to the doctor?""

This is asking if you should seek treatment, and ergo, medical advice. 


**If you would ask the question of your doctor, it falls under this rule and not allowed. As a general rule, asking for medical advice from internet strangers is never a good idea. If you have questions regarding your condition, you are advised to contact your healthcare provider. If you are a medical provider, we would gently remind you that users are not patients, and you should not be offering medical advice to people who are not your patients.**

If you have an Nvidia card and your drivers are up to date, that may be the issue. RDR2 has not updated to catch up to it yet, and you'd need to roll back your Nvidia drivers to a previous version. 

Bear in mind, if you attempt the Vulkan/DirectX 12 switch that it often is not the cause of the problem and DirectX 12 tends to perform a bit worse overall than Vulkan.

Best way to weigh it up to see if it's worth doing:

Apply 20% of the HTB amount for each year out of the 5 years that you wouldn't be in the relevant property. Basically, 2-3 years. If you started the selling process now, chances are you wouldn't finalize everything until early next year. 

Subtract your current mortgage balance from 400K. 
Factor in ‚Ç¨10k for solicitors fees (for the sale, the purchase of your new property, stamp duty etc).
Up to 5k for the estate agent managing the sale of your property and another 1-2k for a survey, valuation report and anything else that might pop up.

None of those are M2M, like a RC. The first is voice, the third is a sensor, not a data transmission method, and I'll be nice and let clappers slide.

You don't have AF air conditioners, nor TVs, nor stereos, nor car fobs, nor fans, nor zigbee, nor weather stations. No devices replace RF or IR communication with AF.

> That style of symbol was associated has been associated with audio for a long time,

Yes, for audio _processing_. The symbol used for ""this device makes noise"" is that symbol preceded by a speaker symbol.

The ""no sound"" symbol is a crossed speaker (sometimes with your symbol), but it is never your symbol alone. This is becsuse it is very easy to confuse with the multidude of similar symbols with ""emanating waves"", like NFC or wifi.

That symbol is also used for RF in general, and waves of any kind, not just audio.

> They still produced sound audible to humans.

As an unintended consequence. You can still see dark red light on remote controls, in a dark room, and you could still hear interference from gsm or particularily strong transmmitrers on amplifiers. That doesn't mean IR remotes use visible light, or GSM uses AF, it's just an unintended consequence.

> it do be wireless tho.  I don't see any wires. Do you?

Sure, I'll concede to the language burn. Obviously things buzzing and beeping to talk to one another is how electronics communicate and what consumers understand by wireless.

Do you blast Beethoven's fifth @ 1000W to unlock your car, or do you use RF? Both are wireless, but nobody really assumes AF modulation means wireless.

CompetitiveWoW,"> I don't understand what healers want from the game. Do they want to just throw some maintanance spell and dps?

Yes, a lot of them seem to want that - minus the DPS part actually. There's a frighteningly large amount of people who want a healer situation like in SL S3, where you could mostly get carried to KSM as a healer by merely keeping up Riptide or Renew or whatever and just throwing out the odd Flash Heal - even the prospect of filling empty globals with DPS seems to be undesirable for that group of players.

For the longest time these players got pretty much free rating for veeeeery little effort - and that changed when we got SL S4 starting to introduce very relevant healer checks all of the sudden (which they then nerfed 10 times over), only to double down on them in DF S1 (which they then nerfed 10 times over), only to then double down on them again in DF S2 (which they mostly have yet to nerf).

Without trying to put anyone down, but most healers in WoW are pretty much equivalent to like silver rating support players in LoL that would actually end up in Bronze if they were to play any other role. They just want to press heal on CD the second someone drops to 95%, but the second someone then drops to 90% everything's just too much.

> It's very rewarding. 

And also giga punishing.

You can easily get by with 1 subpar DPS in your group, but if your healer can't make the healing check on the third boss in Halls of Infusion your key is just bricked. That's a lot of responsibility resting on a single person.

> I hope these healer checks don't go away.

Eh - I'm fine with healer checks in general, the issue I have with them is if 2 dungeons have vastly different healing requirements at the very same key level. Like the Frog guy in Halls of Infusion literally does half as much damage as the Forgemaster in Neltharus - their pulsing AoE damage comes out at the same intervals and hits for the same amount, yet Forgemaster randomly also follows that one up with a debuff on 3 people. Alternatively Magmatusk in Neltharus hitting people with a DoT that ticks for 20% of people's HP that lasts for 25 seconds and you can't do anything about vs Brackenhide's first boss hitting people with a DoT ticking for similar amounts... yet that one can be removed by getting people over 90% HP just once. I don't particularly enjoy healing a +20 Uldaman feeling like healing a +24 Freehold - I'd prefer a +20 Uldaman being as challenging on my healer as a +20 Freehold.",Gasparde,1686646217.0

PMG's one glaring mystification of the studio's work processes‚Äìwhich turned out to be the video's hobby horse‚Äìis that they took for granted that the work was basically chugging along and would've been fine were it not for the absentee/disorganized/asshole Artists.

TrueChristian,"Confess your sin. 

Repent (change course of thinking and doing).  Is this a sin that is reoccurring, or ..? If so, it may take an even more aggressive approach. Reply back and I will go more in response for suggestions.

Now to receive peace, I suggest that you meditate on the scriptures to gain faith and pray & proclaim the promise of scriptures out loud with bold authority. 

The enemy is a liar and wants to keep the children of God oppressed and under torment‚Ä¶. But Christ has come to destroy the works of the devil and to give us an abundance of life. The Kingdom of God is within us! Greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world. The gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church of Jesus Christ. No weapon formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that rises up against you in judgment shall be condemned.

Come on, rise up in prayer and fight the good fight. The enemy has been defeated. You serve a mighty God, one that is rich in mercy. Who sent His Son for you and for me as the perfect sacrifice to buy our freedom and victory!!!! He didn‚Äôt just purchase our salvation (although that would have still been more than what we deserved) but He purchased our healing and freedom. If we are in Christ then there is no more fear of condemnation ! God is for us and not against us. Nothing can separate us from the Love of God. 

Beloved put your hope in God and in His goodness. Believe that He has overcome this world and that He has called you as a son, heir to His Kingdom, more than a conqueror. You can come into His throne room with bold assurance that you shall receive grace and mercy. You have spiritual access to His rich and glorious inheritance. If you are a child of God then you are not a slave to fear. Come and receive your portion in the Lord. Rejoice and give thanks because Christ has paid your debt once and for all, show Him your gratitude and glorify Him!!! 

Often times I find my deliverance comes from praise and worship. As the scripture says it can throw off the enemy‚Äôs camp and send them into a derision. But also because when your mind is stayed steadfast on the Lord you obtain His peace. So stop focusing at the problem and gaze upon the beauty of the Lord. 

Pour out your heart to him, ask for forgiveness for grieving His Spirit. And to blot away all your transgressions and iniquity. Plead His mercy would cleanse your heart and teach you in the way of righteousness. And give thanks for the finished work of Christ Jesus. Praise the Lord for the shedding of the perfect lamb of God has given you forgiveness and redeemed your life from the pit.",Best-Positive5492,1686645695.0

YoneMains,"Idk why but rushing Bork almost always results in me losing tower dude... am I prioritizing the Bork items incorrectly? I buy the recurve bow into the vamp scepter instead of pickaxe for some reason, is that my problem?

If I'm behind I rush galeforce after getting t2 boots of course, and always get a powerspike that completely saves me. Long before I even complete the item, it feels like the zeal and the BF sword are just so much stronger than the equivalent investment into Bork.

I also feel like Bork requires a specific playstyle that I don't fully understand. Especially when it comes to applying the Bork effect onto the first thing you Q and nothing else, etc. Seems like it takes more skill (which I may be lacking) and an adjustment to playstyle that I don't fully comprehend.

sto,"It's 40 points, not 40 days, and you can earn 2 points per day, so it's only 20 days to finish the event.  The event runs for 30 days, so there's plenty of time.

It's not your fault, it's not spelled out in this announcement like it usually is, because... reasons, but the TFOs and Story Mission give 2 points of progress, and the Patrols give 1 point.  So you can do the Patrols if you prefer, but you'll have to do 2 of them to get your full 2 points each day. The ""playstartrekonline"" link above about the Looming Threats event does have the full details, including the end date of July 13th, and more mission and reward info.

Auri might remind Kvothe of his mother (not in appearance per se). He thinks of them both as sweet, loving, and kind people.

OnlyFansReviews,"Your request post has joined the moderating queue and will be evaluated for manual approval by mods. If your post does not get approved within the next 24 hours it is because it has not followed the request post guideline. You can read the guideline below, if you feel your post does not follow our guideline please delete it and repost. 

Request posts are for finding a specific ONLYFANS page and creator to SUBSCRIBE to. You can use request posts to find an onlyfans page that that offers specific content and aesthetics, genres and themes you are looking for.  

For example:  
*'I am looking for a busty  creator over 35 y/o who creates 'hot wife' content.'*  
*'I am looking for a creator with a nerdy aesthetic who uses bad dragon toys.'*  

The body of posts should go into more detail. You can include things such as budget, what kind of video content you would like available on their page or tip-able services and deal breakers.  

Requests are NOT for recruiting any nsfw creator/ seller to give you GFE, video call, sexting, someone nice to be your friend, someone to make a custom for you. This negates the point of making a request when you consider that nearly every onlyfans creator offers these services as tip-able extras on their page. Your request should primarily reference the on the feed content a creator is making or a creator with a specific look and style.  

Things you absolutely cannot request:  
- Someone just to chat to.  
- A new or 'small' creator.  
- Custom content/ sexting/ video calls. You may specify that you would like the onlyfans creator/ page you are requesting to have that as an option, but it shouldn't be the basis of your request.  
- Freebies of any kind including dms before subscribing, free content or previews that aren't already readily available on the creator's social media.  
- Taboo content, things that are against onlyfans guidelines. 
- Nothing that could compromise the creators safety or privacy should be requested.  
- Payment methods outside of onlyfans.  
- Budget that goes outside the [pricing guideline](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyFansReviews/comments/ukpora/pricing_guideline/). 

Example of requests that will be removed and poster banned:  
*'Looking for a small creator for girlfriend experience.'*  
*'Looking for a young creator to make a custom.'*

You don‚Äôt qualify enough leads? The inference being they think your role is just to qualify as many leads as possible. Fill the pipeline with as much shite as you can and failure to do so means you‚Äôre not selling well enough?

Info: what qualification criteria are used by the BDRs?

The BDR manager needs retraining on sales process and qualification. In my view, openly saying to an AE that you‚Äôre de-prioritising their territory to punish them for not qualifying more leads should be disciplinary proceedings for the BDR. A warning at a minimum.

Your manager (probably with you supporting) needs to have a conversation with your sales VP about how the BDR team is functioning. Share what you‚Äôre seeing as the VP may not be aware.

crusaderkings3,"All children have a claim on their parents' titles. Even if daughters usually can't inherit. This is also a good way to increase your territory - invite landless princesses to press their claim on a kingdom.

Do your current character have any children? Daughters preferably? Use them to secure alliances either with strong vassals or outside rulers, that can help you in the coming civil war.

Sway and gift/bribe those of your vassals who aren't completely in the red. Getting just one or two vassals off the faction to install your PC's sister will sometimes/often be enough to make the faction weak enough to not press its claim. This can also be done through marriage-alliance with said vassal.

Finally, in the war, you have the advantage of first strike. Even if your forces and the rebel forces are technically equal, they have to gather theirs first. Once they can press their demand, raise your forces next to one of their capitals and wait. Then wipe out one of the larger rebel armies (can be a bit costly). This way, you will already be ahead in the civil war.

I also prefer not to let my sons marry - or marry as late as possible. Only my heir gets to marry early. This way the line is secure, but my other sons also can't secure alliances through their children. Oh and give your heir a county if you can - it seems to make him more efficient at propagating and gets him an early start of lifestyle choices (can backfire though with him getting killed in a personal war). 

Hope it helps.",42stoics,1686649353.0

LastEpoch,"Yes, exactly my point. Paladin has easy access to the baseline defenses and good block support. VK has a bit harder time getting those but with T20+ gear on the correct bases, BoH and farmed Blessings those become no issue anymore and the block mitigation is similiar as most of the viable Block support is Block Chance. At that point a Ravenous Void comes into the picture as well - VK can wear it without much hinderence to it's dps, Paladin has to sacrifice an entire slot. This is 15% *less damage taken*. VK has more damage due to echoes *and* more leech, so VK also has the higher recovery - which makes the higher health pool matter a lot.

Bogleheads,"> Most of the users here have no idea what this dispute is even about

Half their subscriptions disappearing might help clue them in. Surely you'd agree that most of the mods and primary content contributors know what it's about. You seem to.

The point of going dark was to remind reddit that the (live, human) users, the mods, and the content contributors are their product. That's beyond reasonable that they want customers to pay a premium for advertising space and valuable data, and it would be wonderful if reddit were to turn a profit. But first they need a product.

It's been 20 years now and they still haven't [found us](https://mstdn.social/@davidrevoy@framapiaf.org/110532792812174980) yet.

> (and frankly, the accusation of ""corporate greed"" is no charge at all to total market index fund investors. ""Corporate greed"" is why we get a return on our investment)

The winners and the losers alike are all greedy; that doesn't make losing a winning proposition. Our gains come from the winners. The winners are the ones with great products, formidable moats, excellent managers and fortress balance sheets. This dump has had a billion dollars dumped into it and they can't figure out how to show ads to people without starting a conniption.

Do you really want that hot mess weighing down your passive investments? I certainly don't.

FWIW I don't really care whether this sub went dark or not, nor whether anything happens to reddit. I just took umbrage with your reasoning.

I haven't found one in Australia much cheaper than $300, and it's not in my budget to buy one for a few more months.

But that would have required me to not eat ice cream, and that's not an option. 

I like to have a pint once a week. Ideally I'd have one every day but I can't afford $10 a day... So clearly the creami is going to pay for itself.

Then Muhammed personally smashed every statue in the one in Mecca, claimed it's for muslims and then invented a story about how Abraham built it even though there is zero historical evidence of Abraham existing let alone going to Mecca to build a block.",Gizka1235,1686653172.0

FIREUK,"Agents usually have two charges.  One for signing contracts with a tenant, one for the ongoing management.

For signing, the tenant can just move onto a rolling monthly contract.  There is no need to sign a new one if you are happy with that.

For management fees, you can just give notice and work directly with the tenant to solve repairs and collect rent.

The 9% fee sounds like a management fee which you should be able to terminate with notice.  You can then self manage or move to another agent.",Mysterious_Act_3652,1686643707.0

shanghai,"I know it may sound wasteful, but see if it is in your budget to do both.  I have friends who did this and it was very convenient for them because the universities can be very strict about guests, curfews, etc.  Also, the rooms were smaller and sometimes the amenities weren't very good.  This made their off-campus apartments a refuge during vacations and weekends.

On the other hand, it can be a real pain to commute to campus in Shanghai, so having a place to stay on campus would be helpful during the week.  For example, I once took Mandarin courses at ECNU but - even though the campus was normally a 20 minutes away by taxi - it took almost an hour to get to class.  This was because of:

* Morning rush hour.
* The route to campus was mostly two lanes on each side of the road, which was way too small for all the traffic.  I could see it going into the distance forever. 
* The gate at which the bus dropped us off was on the opposite side of campus from where I needed to go.
* We had to use our student ID to get into the campus so there would sometimes be a very long line.
* I could have taken a taxi to the other gate but it wasn't worth it.  It only saved about 10 minutes (due to morning rush hour) and cost about ¬•35 per trip.  I definitely could not afford to do that for five days per week for an entire semester.

When I would be rushing to class, I'd see students in their pajamas (obvious that they had just woken up) walking to class and I would think ""Dammit - I want to stay on campus so I can roll out of bed and get to class in ten minutes"".

I hope this helps!

Kingdom,"Tbh, all the parts where the Generals go around looking at cities like Ousen did for Gyou, Qin getting surprised at Retsubi, and now Tou at Han's capital to scout for potential openings are nothing more than dramatic effects for me. 

>!There was zero chance that the Qin did not know about Retsubi's design considering how close Retsubi was to Qin's border. Even if the Qin wasn't scouting for an opening to siege it, the Qin would still have scouted it to see how big it was, especially its medical facilities, granaries, and its practical value as a launchpad from Zhao into Qin's territory. !<

There was also no travel embargo between the seven states and spies were operating rampantly. Merchants were freely trading and people were migrating everywhere (mainly to Qin). 

The military HQ of these states would have all the details and information on all the notable cities and settlements. All they needed to do was send an experience builder attached to the army on a scouting mission all over and report back to their home state. 

And since city gate guards were habitually corrupt those days, it just couldn't be easier for anyone to smuggle out carved-out notes containing key features and elements in a city's build in relation to defense.

Wingstop Atomic has to be the hottest of the fast food chains though, and even in my love of extreme heat, especially Habanero, the hottest of Jalape√±os, ocxasionally some Ghost, etc, I always have some atomic when I eat Wingstop, but never too much.

NoStupidQuestions,"YES. Actually, this will actually be more beneficial than trying to start a whole exercise regimen, because you'll be able to keep doing it. It's easy to talk yourself out of going to the gym for an hour, but it's hard to talk yourself out of something that's going to take less than two minutes. 

But the true magic of it is that once you're doing ten push-ups every day for a week or two, you're going to feel stronger, and you're going to feel empowered because you've kept it up. So you might up that to 15 push-ups. Maybe a week later you'll decide to add a ten minute walk. That'll become easy, and it'll turn into a longer walk -- and you'll realize that this daily walk is actually doing wonders for your mental health, too. Maybe you'll want to start doing two walks a day. Or the walk will feel easy that you'll say, ""Hey, I'm going to try to jog for 30 seconds and walk the rest of the way.""

This is how genuine change happens. Small, tiny, manageable increments that you can sustain. I wish more people would preach *this* instead of big changes that are hard to stick with. 

You've got this. Do those 10 push-ups. When it feels good -- and it WILL feel good -- just add a little something else.",BrigidKemmerer,1686656184.0

10s,"For control racquets I have tried pro staff v13, pure strike vs and gravity pro 2023. I would recommend gravity pro. 

That is only if you are ready and have good technique, ie you are no longer using your arm but the power comes from your unit turn and racquet drop. It's very soft, I feel minimal impact when I full strike the ball and you can rip balls with it all day but it is 315 grams and the swing weight is 330+. So if you don't know how to swing properly you will get tennis elbow. The 100 SQ racquet is also good too since you are already using a 100inch. I m too used to smaller head sizes so I ended up not sticking with it. 

Pure strike vs is very soft unlike the other pure strikes. But it has close to zero power my swing weight came close to 310 which is unusable. To do anything you would need to add some lead to the hoop. I won't go for that if you aren't okay to experiment with lead. But when u do you really have all the control you need. It really isn't for every one tho. You really have to be powerful to use that racquet.",Ok-Manufacturer2475,1686657068.0

learnmachinelearning,"You are probably thinking of data and concept drift. Your variable distribution across many features is changing over time as a function of the model generating a feedback in the data. There are some techniques to identify if/when this is happening, but for those to work, you must have access to metrics internal and external to your model.

With the crime example: if behavior shifts, you will see a drift in distribution on your predictive features. When they drift beyond a threshold, your model performance will start to rapidly decay.
It can also be a drift in target label definitions, like what is a ‚Äúgood loan‚Äù in finance. These are more difficult to catch.

One way to prepare your pipeline for something like this:
- know your domain, have a good understanding of the reality behind the numbers
- tons of EDA and residual analysis to identify edge cases and points of collapse in performance in advance.
- continuous or frequent monitoring and alerts. population stability index is a friend.",CheesyRegression,1686645195.0

navy,"So when CSCSU and TSC merged, the new SCSTC command that owns ET A, ATT, etc gained ownership of the barracks as well, so you may get orders to instruct or to NMTI. The schoolhouse is more than willing to get NMTI‚Äôs stick time to blue badge and ultimately MTS, if that‚Äôs what you get sent to. Or you get ATT, ET A, and you instruct. Duty usually consists of quarterdeck watches, military presence (MILPRES), or barracks duty officer (BDO), where you‚Äôre an NMTI during the off hours, but you‚Äôd be in 8 section duty.

But off the cuff it‚Äôs one or the other usually. And there‚Äôs opportunities to swap between barracks and schoolhouse down the line to make sure you get MTS before you transfer out.

Debian is much mooore predictable. Every 2 years release with refreshed packages, with 3 years of support, sometimes for limited number of packages, for 5 years. And that is last 15 or 20 years. 

openSUSE had regular release when is ready, every 6 months, every 8 months, after year, changed for Leap from version 13.2 into version 42.1, back to version 15.0. Release every year, with major rebase every four years, so after 15.3 should be 16.0, but replaced by 15.4.

French,"Correct. I believe the difference between the two cultures is largely the source of the common American impression or fear that French people are ‚Äúrude.‚Äù Americans are conditioned to engage in ‚Äúlook at me, and make a big deal out of me!‚Äù types of behavior. (I blame untrammeled capitalism.) They will also try to make a big deal out of you as a French person, thinking this is ‚Äúnice‚Äù: ‚ÄúYour English is SOOO amazing. It is AWESOME!!!‚Äù 

Coming from a culture that values being a bit more understated, French people may be embarrassed even by these well-meaning attempts at connection. Meanwhile, Americans might expect French people to lavish praise on them for speaking French, even if they are doing so at an A1 level. 

We tend to forget that many Europeans have spent a decade or longer learning and practicing English and that they expect zero praise even though they have attained a high level of proficiency. Why? Because this is pretty normal in Europe. While they might enjoy practicing English and feel proud at times of their fluency, they mostly use English as a form of practical communication between people from different countries. It‚Äôs the quickest way to get a transaction done, not always a bonding moment where you comment on the other person‚Äôs accomplishments.

In the United States, though, the vast majority of native-born people are monolingual, so learning French or Italian IS unusual. We‚Äôll start speaking our new language around the house to impress our family after about two lessons. 

(Personally, I love it when Americans try to open up and learn about other cultures and languages as it may reduce the chance that we incinerate the planet.)

* In Low Chaos, Emily makes a drawing for Corvo of his face labeled 'DADDY', to match one she's already made of Jessamine labeled 'MOMMY'.
* In Havelock's final diary entry he writes about Corvo's ""loyalty to the Kaldwin women"" and wonders if Emily is really his daughter (as a military man he may have been less in-the-know for the court intrigues).
* In High Chaos, in the final mission Pendleton tells Corvo that ""everyone knew"" about the relationship

Corvo never yells from the rooftops that Emily is his kid, but it's quite clear that this was the intent of the writers.

By the second game, set fifteen years after the first, it's well known to be fact that Corvo and Jessamine were a couple, and Emily was their child. It's mentioned in several in-universe books, if you play as Emily in Low Chaos she can mention she's half-Serkonan in a speech, and she regularly calls Corvo ""Father"".  My headcanon is that after Jessamine's death and Emily's coronation, there's a lot less pressure to hide the relationship - after all, what are they gonna do? Find another Empress?

These days, I couldn't give a flip. Are they clean? Are they a good person? Do we share the same morals? Sex is just sex. Sex with someone you love is different.

Otherwise, maybe you eat too much at lunch. A particularly big meal can make people sleepy, especially when it's hot on top of it. You could try to eat less at lunch, even if that means eating more in the evening.

wrestling,"I coached wrestling for years, starting at youth/middle school and now helping out on the high school team. I enjoy wrestling the big high schoolers.

wildrift,"I quit lol about a year ago (was playing every moment I wasn't at work. It was ruining my life). WR is a quick fix when I have the craving to play, but it lacks the depth, especially as a jungler. 

-rune system is way less impactful on your playstyle than in regular league. Plus, waaaay less runes to chose from.
-lots of things make the game play far easier (buff sharing in the late game) 
-smite auto upgrades super fast, and there is only one option. I don't know if they changed the way it worked on PC league recently, but there used to be different types of smite. 
-way less Champs means there is a way higher chance your champ is ether picked or banned. 
-leashing is gone because jungle clear is so easy. 
-my main isn't and probably never will be in the game (this is personal and I get nobody else cares about my main) 
-less items means less build expression, and lots of the cool items in the game have been gutted to be nothing more than a damage item (duskblade) 
-game practically marks last hits which makes last hitting way to easy. 
-respwan timers are so short and the map is so small soloing objectives early, which was commonplace on PC, doesn't really happen in WR. 

Those are the main things I miss from PC league.",HighDPSGlizzy,1686661406.0

A few hours away is a college and they seem to have a boil water notice every few weeks. The school has it own treatment center but is designed to small or atleast was designed for average hourly flow vs poop before a test flow ha. It flowers to the towns treatment system but seems like atleast once or twice a month they have a boil water notice due to them both being maxed out and having to release stuff early.

Not sure of the numbers but say like 5-7k people live on the campus but folks commuting to college might be like 15k+ a day. So you get tons of folks come in after a decent to long drive to take a big test and a whole lot of flushing done at once ha.

That's funny coming from you, the only true danger is you. If you like go into the fascist speech to defend your words. Having your own thoughts or words is fine even if it's bizarre and stupid, freedom of speech is exists. But don't be surprised if you get compliments, uncomfortable stares, insults, or even arrested for your speech. If you say that everyone deserves rights, people can react and agree, if you say racism is justified, people can be upset with you, if call a random stranger an idiot, you could get decked in the face for it.

So say what you want but people can react, your speech comes with consequences depending on what you choose to spew from your mouth. People have the rights to react to what you say.

#define X9_PRINT_ERROR_MSG(msg) x9_print_error_msg(msg)

MiniPCs,">i need it for solidworks...

This single statement defines the whole direction.

Whether desktop or laptop, for Solidworks to properly be supported, our clients have found that two details cannot be sidestepped. And they've tried.

32GB RAM

4GB dedicated VRAM

Unless you can find a great deal, new or used, on a Minisforum HX80G 32GB, mini PCs fail to make the ‚Ç¨500 cut.

>X300 or B660

We have clients that have both, and the general consensus between them is X300 ownership provides better performance and a more economical build than the B660.

Going with the X300, you'll want to focus on Zen 3 Infinity Fabric Architecture for the best optimization. Most of our clients, in the past year, have chosen the Ryzen 5 5500. It's the least expensive Zen 3 to meet the requirement, and comes with a fan and heat sink.

Depending on your region's availability, one of the most popular 32GB 3200Mhz kits is Silicon Power's SP032GXLZU320BDC. Often in the ‚Ç¨55 price range, they have found this to be the most stable Zen 3 budget RAM available.

The Radeon RX 580 is an excellent choice, and often overlooked. Backed by 32GB of RAM, the 8GB of VRAM gives Solidworks optimal room to perform. There's an approximate 35% GPU bottleneck, which is actually to be expected with an older card like the RX 580. In terms of bottlenecks, a GPU bottleneck is considered better than a CPU bottleneck, as the system will still have processing power.

And for best support overall, make sure that you invest in a Gen3x4 NVMe SSD, with read/write speeds of at least 3,000/2,000MHz. Once again, a client favorite is the Silicon Power 512GB SU512GBP34A80M28AB, R/W up to 3,400/2,300MB/s. SolidWorks, along with Windows, tends to read/write the storage simultaneously. A faster NVMe is less noticeable.

We hope this information helps.

#Do not ask for medical advice, and do not play doctor

What constitutes medical advice?
***

* ""What is this?"" 

 This is asking someone to diagnose the issue, and is medical advice.

* ""What should I do?""

This is asking someone to advise treatment, and is medical advice.

 * ""Should I go to the doctor?""

This is asking if you should seek treatment, and ergo, medical advice. 


**If you would ask the question of your doctor, it falls under this rule and not allowed. As a general rule, asking for medical advice from internet strangers is never a good idea. If you have questions regarding your condition, you are advised to contact your healthcare provider. If you are a medical provider, we would gently remind you that users are not patients, and you should not be offering medical advice to people who are not your patients.**

3. Rob added me to the original invite
4. My inbox show the invite with Sorry...No updates happen

Solution
1. In my android phone find invite from Rob (real organizer)
2. Scroll down on the invite and find the ics file attached to it. 
3. Click to download 
4. Find downloaded file on notifications and click it 
5. Calendar event opens and at the bottom it says ""update event"" (something like that)
6. Click that
7. Now rob shows as the organizer and I no longer have the issue. Further updates sent by Rob do stick and apply

Make soft mewing second nature, correct your neck and body posture, learn the proper swallow pattern,chew hard foods, hard gum like mastic, and get out of your comfort zone, exercise daily. 

I'm sure if you can do these things for the next say 5-10 years, you are very much on path to achieve significant results.  

You could upswing your jaw which could ultimately lead to an increase in your Ramus length.

GakiNoTsukai,"Morning Membahs, here is a little excerpt from Minna no Ie („Åø„Çì„Å™„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„Åà) or known as ""All About Our House"" directed by Mitani Koki (most will remember him from the fifth Silent Library or GnT episode #0906)  
  
I've seen Bus Jack, Bus Jack Returns, R100, Saya Samurai, Siren, and Symbol, but not Minna no Ie until last night. I found it to be an endearing little tale that made me nostalgic of the early 2000s, so I thought I'd share.  
  
It's a charming story about a happily married couple and their home.  
A screenwriter (Tanaka Naoki) and his art teacher wife (Yagi Akiko) decide to build a new house in the countryside. The work is split up between the interior designer friend (Karasawa Toshiaki) and the master carpenter (Tanaka Kunie) who is also the wife's father.   
  
Two wills clash when the interior designer's modernist vision collides with the master carpenter's traditional methods. A puppydog Tanaka is caught between his father in law and his wife's friend. Despite having to mediate between the father's stubborness and the friend's novel vision, he has complete faith and confidence in both's skill and expertise.  
After trials and tribulations the two artisans come to mutually respect each other for their skills and values. The house is finished with traditional and modernist elements albeit with a main door that opens outwards, and a japanese room that might be too big...  
A wonderfully quaint story about the chaos of building a home for one's family.

At the 2002 Japanese Academy Awards Minna no Ie was nominated for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Newcomer, Best Screenplay, and Most Popular Actor. Of which it won Best Newcomer for Tanaka Naoki and Yagi Akiko. Tanaka-san also won Most Popular performer.",FluffySeaPancake,1686661045.0
udub,"Greek folks aren't very welcoming to non-traditional students. Or at least the sororities sure as fuck weren't. Maybe the frats will be different. Dry frats are a good option if you're going Greek, although beware that doesn't mean the guys don't party, it just means there's no alcohol allowed inside the house (and they may not strictly adhere to that rule either). At least one of the frats I remember went dry as punishment for something or another in the past. I can't say much about the non-party ones. Greek life doesn't usually see much of them for obvious reasons so not many people can recommend much in the way of them.

You should definitely ""interview"" very well with a frat before you decide to join. Being 25 is a lot different from being 18. Even at 23 I don't think I'd join a sorority again, I'm in a much different place now.",commanderquill,1686643562.0

I'm using a laptop with a Intel iGPU and Nvidia dGPU

But when I tried to run ' rmmod nvidia' to detach nvidia gpu, it stated nvidia was used by a process, that PID was not appear in `top`.

I guess that's Display Manager (SDDM) using it? ( later proved it was the DM)

Necrontyr,"Are Kodex started off in ninth edition like it was already behind because even though we got a significant greenish refresh of new data sheets and units, overall many of the characters and units were over priced for what they did.

To make things worse, they were a lot of rules that got in each other‚Äôs way and D synergized certain abilities. For example, you could not roll the animation protocols on models that were destroyed outside of the shooting phase and fight phase. So if you got charged by orcs and they had a special rule that caused damage on a successful charge you were out of luck. Then you had to deal with the psychic phase where psychics damage completely prevented reanimation protocols from activating.

And lastly, we animation protocols didn‚Äôt even really work on units that had multiple wounds.

Then we had dynastic agents which created all sorts of confusing scenarios, because a lot of people read the rule incorrectly because GW should have made it just a short and sweet explanation. For example, dynastic agents never receive any dynastic codes. Many players assumed this meant Praetorians did not benefit from the second directive on the round your dynasties saver protocol was active, which was incorrect.  Favorite protocols are a diagnostic code but it‚Äôs affecting the protocol itself. It‚Äôs not a code that is given to Praetorians. You will notice when you read the section on command protocols because it states that all units in your army game, the benefits of all the active command protocols that round as long as that unit has the command protocols rule on their data sheet which Praetorians do. The three Catan shards do not, and will not ever receive command protocols because they have the enslaved star gods rule, which is different. 

The main point for dynastic agents is that they do not break your army rules for including them in your army, despite the fact that they lack your dynasties keyword.

Another good example which didn‚Äôt hit me until later in the addition, was that overlords with resurrection orbs could never use them to target Triarch Praetorians, which completely made my head pop.

When you read the rule on resurrection orbs, it states that you have to target a friendly dynasty unit, and unfortunately Praetorians, although they may be friendly, they do not have the dynasti part. 

I think a lot of this was unintentional by the designers. And I think they were trying to pull their punches and fear of writing an overly strong Kodex, yet instead reanimator‚Äôs, came out of the door at 120 points, and they are range, which was 9 inches in the inDominus rulebook down to 6 inches when the official court rules were released.

Everybody scoffed because no one‚Äôs going to pay 120 points for a monster, which made it extremely hard to benefit from cover, and you had to be in constant line of sight, and within 6 inches of the target you were trying to heal while having a toughness score of five with only five wounds.

And then they decided to troll us by giving him pretty decent guns, which shot out a total of six ranged attacks that had a strength of six and I believe the AP was -2 however, the range was only 12 inches. How are you going to shoot 12 inch guns when you‚Äôre sitting as far back as you can which is 6 inches in order to keep your healing beam on that one unit you‚Äôre following around while trying to stay out of line of sight.

And then there were locust heavy destroyers I believe they were 70 points each when they first came out from one model that was toughness five with four wounds. These fat chunky boys with access to one of the only reliable shots we had when shooting at dangerous targets would cost over 200 points for a unit of three yet they were easy to one shot and then as the game went on suddenly a lot of other units we‚Äôre getting access to, 2+ armor saves which we only see in the Necron Codex on titanic units like the monolith.

Since they started giving 2+ to certain units in the Admech Codex, and then increasing their invulnerable, saves from 6+ up to 5+ kind a got under my skin, because the name of the rule that gave them the invulnerable save, was called cybernetic enhancements on their rangers.

Meanwhile, Necron warriors who were 100% covered in metal did not receive a natural invulnerable save .

There‚Äôs so many feel bad moments about ninth edition for that faction I just get irritated talking about it .

Towards the end of ninth edition, there were so many Band-Aids. They actually ended up in validating, certain relics and stratagems through the dataslate. 

Doomstalker could‚Äôve been pretty decent if they had just been more specific or did something a little stronger with the sentinel construct rule, which allowed it to Overwatch each time a friendly unit what is the target of a charge while within 6 inches of it. I remember there was a clause in parentheses that said, as a Doomstalker was also  the target of that charge.

That last line was extremely important, because there were abilities and command protocols that could trigger it to overwatch on a five and a six, making the Doomstalker a charge deterrent",Tanglethorn,1686664846.0

juridischadvies,">Voor de duidelijkheid: er is hier nooit iets expliciet over gezegd, tot twee weken terug toen de huisbaas via mail stuurde dat het terras gemeenschappelijk is. Dat lijkt me toch ook wel te lezen als een rechtsgeldige afspraak?

Vind ik een lastige. Het is in ieder geval niet netjes, maar vraag is of hier een afspraak is die afdwingbaar is. Een belofte is normaal gesproke niet afdwingbaar als die geen deel uitmaakt van een (wederkerige) overeenkomst. Bij een wederkerige overeenkomst geldt bv dat Pietje A geeft aan Klaasje, en Klaasje daar B voor teruggeeft. Bv huur betalen voor een woning. Omdat jij hier geen tegenprestatie hebt (je betaalt niet voor het gebruik van het terras) kan dat dus lastig zijn. Echter, er zitten veel haken en ogen aan het verbintenissenrecht en anderen op deze sub zijn daar veel beter in thuis.

Wat betreft vluchtwegen zijn er in Nederland [normen](https://rijksoverheid.bouwbesluit.com/Inhoud/docs/wet/bb2012/hfd2/afd2-12), helaas zijn die voor de leek behoorlijk complex. 2 vluchtwegen zijn niet altijd verplicht, soms is 1 vluchtweg voldoende. Ik durf niet te zeggen of in jouw situatie afdwingbaar is of die brandtrap ook voor jou toegankelijk moet zijn. Wel lijkt het me in algemene zin vreemd als die afgesloten kan worden door 1 bewoner. Ik zou bij de verhuurder erop aandringen dat die brandtrap altijd toegankelijk moet zijn. Dat wil op zichzelf dan nog niet zeggen dat je het terras daarmee ook mag gebruiken als terras.",McMafkees,1686666587.0

fragrance,"1. I think I follow in a big part the cultural norms I am raised in when choosing fragrance for myself (I'm European, 38F, heterosexual), also considering that I'm  wearing mostly European brands who employ mostly European perfumers. When a perfume is inspired by other cultures, such as using oud, it's always within the European interpretation. So I'm mindful of that. However, getting into niche fragrances some years ago has helped me realize how any person can really wear anything, the only rule is that we like it.

2. Perfume is self expression and confidence, yes.
3. I have a lot to say about class. In the US, I've noticed that class is often talked about along with race and gender, but in my culture class is a separate issue and there is a whole theory that cannot be replaced witb post modern ones. Not saying that other issues are not important, I just cannot view it as the same as class overrides all. I understand though, that in the US the atmosphere is very, very different, for example, there is a hostile environment against queer groups and banning drag shows that here in Europe we cannot believe it's real!! So, I think that fragrance showcases class, yes. It always will. There's no way around it. The bottles in someone's shelf show their status, as does someone's handbag logo when they carry it. There are always discussions on ""smelling expensive"" or ""smelling like cheap body spray"" for example. This is like it is. The snobbery of the perfume communities and shops, don't get me started on that.

As for moderation, we all need to have a respectful environment to discuss fragrance. I don't think banning words is the solution, unless they are slurs. Or removing comments. Unless it's insulting a person's or a group's dignity. But having a healthy disagreement is part of any free and progressive society. And we can agree to disagree respectfully. It seems there is room for only one ideology while there are plenty, as well as everything in between. I might be wrong, you might be wrong, but we have the right to be wrong as long as we don't insult people and are civil towards each other always.",myrrhardente,1686669403.0

NewYuzuPiracy,"running almost all of the same settings as OP except:

* **No Steam Frame limit** (just the 30fps lock from the static 30 mod) because I was experiencing crazy input lag when doing static 60 and then steam frame limiting to 30 (more on fps later)
* **No Island Fix mod**. I may be wrong, I never tested it to see if it got a mystical performance improvement... but my understanding was this was only for 2x and up scaling. And you're pretty much locked to 1x (720p) on the Deck
* And the biggest difference... **SteamOS 3.5**. I think I was running almost exactly this setup and also experiencing exactly what OP was experiencing. And then I decided to just test out SteamOS 3.5 and now I'm **averaging** 29-30fps probably. Big dips are in dense areas (Lookout, Kakariko, etc) where it goes sometimes to low 20s and also random very quick dips to \~15 which I think is shader caching because it almost always happens in areas I've never been and it's pretty infrequent. 

These claims are not lies? I couldn't be bothered to record my performance and I'm sure other people have... But if enough people are like, ""yes, I need the proof"", I can make a video. Feels wild that there's a post like this without exploring an enormously easy and well-documented way to increase performance (OS 3.5).

So you can drill sequencing for hours and not let your brain go to mush. 

How long did it take me? Honestly, I still learn a thing or two from LG, but it's more different inferences I can make to make me even *more* efficient.

Only reason I'm not using them as much is because of the index fight, they're slightly resistant to blunt stagger AND they use the same dog piling strat I use (the AI is getting smarter wtf). But I'll definitely review the sweepers cards again to see what I can use to survive the enemies dog piling.

The only reason I never used guns is simply because you know run out of cards and I'm scared I'm not going to do enough damage if I had a deck full of guns. I'll review some gun cards and see if I can fit 1 or 2 cuz I hate losing clashes constantly and damage has been low lately.

And this might be a bit late but how do I do general receptions, as in what do I click in the game to get the general invitations? Cuz I think all I've been doing is the story mission and no side content but I'm not sure.

learnmachinelearning,"Howdy, no worries back propagation is the sharpest part of the learning curve in neural networks. Please forgive my poor video quality (one of the first), but I try to explain how back propagation works with in this code from scratch tutorial here: [https://youtu.be/x2YmEX1XzGI](https://youtu.be/x2YmEX1XzGI) as an additional resource. As well as 3 Blue 1 Browns video [https://youtu.be/tIeHLnjs5U8](https://youtu.be/tIeHLnjs5U8) 

To abridge the idea of back propagation more it sorta works like this:

error : is the **derivative of your loss function**  
find the gradient of error with: **error \* derivative\_of\_activation(prediction)**  
find the change in weights by:  
**dot(layer\_before\_inputs , gradient )**

just looking at these 3 steps we have the formula to be able to preform backwards propagation on a perceptron ( 2 layer NN ). Notice how all parts of the neural network are used such as the:

* predicted out
* true out
* inputs

the only thing that is not used is the weights, and that is because we are looking to edit them, so they are a 'fixed' value until the end. Now! if we are to increase the layers by 1, to give us a 3rd layer, we now have to find a new gradient for the previous layer. This comes from taking the 

**dot( gradient , weights\_before\_output ) \* derivative\_of\_activation(layer\_before\_output)**

Similar to before everything now gets used in backwards propagation except for the weights right at the input to the first hidden layer. You are chaining along the gradient throughout the neural network and recalculating a new gradient for each layer each time.

The loud minority want so desperately to be YouTubers like Angry Joe and have this passionate vitriol over something.


It can‚Äôt be a simple case of: ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know that I agree with this story point‚Äù. It‚Äôs gotta be :


‚ÄúBLOOBER IS A DISGUSTING TEAM THAT ENCOURAGES DEPRESSED PEOPLE TO KILL THEMSELVES. BOYCOTT THEM! MAKE THEM LOSE THEIR JOBS!‚Äù


The Medium wasn‚Äôt *that* bad. It‚Äôs an interesting concept that‚Äôs forgettable at the worst. 


And no one would even give a shit about their name if it wasn‚Äôt for **Blair Witch**. YouTubers REALLY clung onto that one because it‚Äôs a well known franchise.  But they framed Bloober as this team of incredibly incompetent people because (again) at the worst it‚Äôs just a pretty boring game. NOT the worst game ever made by a loooong stretch.


But to the loud idiots, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúA HUGE INJUSTICE! THEY CANT GET AWAY WITH RUINING THIS FRANCHISE‚Äù. A lot of spoiled brats don‚Äôt even know what a *bad game* is.


And so the seed was planted for bitching about The Medium over *nothing*, and here we are again with Silent Hill 2.

Also, the speed your RAM runs at shouldn't affect WHEA 18 errors, although if you increase RAM speed it also increases the CPU's internal infinity fabric clock to match, and that could cause ID 18 errors. Tho it shouldn't be an issue unless you go above 3600MT/s RAM, but older BIOS versions can have issues before that.",ExtraGround3652,1686669186.0

You sound like a Freud fan. What do you think of his Penis Envy theory and what about his coke addiction: the article I posted isn't a hatchet job because *it's all true.*

America had put Freud on a pedestal ($$) and the rest of the world sees him for what he *actually* was.

I was stunned to come to America in 1992 to find how many young and/or newly qualified therapists seem to worship Freud. The guy was an utter crackpot.

Jung,"I wonder if the solution would be to surrender and accept the power that being perceived as ‚Äòdumb‚Äô or ‚Äòstupid‚Äô has over you, and accepting the inability to change peoples minds if they choose to see you that way. ‚ÄòSo what if I am dumb? Is that something to fear? Why? Would a dumb version of me deserve to be treated this way? Would that version of me care? Is the real bind in my inability to stop trying to prove I‚Äôm not stupid?‚Äô  
The real game you‚Äôre trapped in is not that you need to disprove being dumb, but that you‚Äôre caught in snare of what someone else thinks of you and attempting to manipulate that.  
Let go of the attachment that people need to see you as smart and you won‚Äôt be overwhelmed with shame when you sense others perceiving you as dumb. Rather than fixing the bind, take notice of the things it makes you feel and why you are determined to avoid them.",Androwren,1686667007.0

gigabytegaming,"Chiming in here. Using the same board and having the exact same issues as well. I was able to finally get rid of it (at least until Gigabyte fixes it¬¥s shit) with the info posted in this post. So thanks for that!I want to use 4 NVMEs but can live with 3 for now. Currently, in the fixed state, i have populated M2A (WD-SN850), M2B (WD-SN750) and M2C (WD-N770). It only fixed itself once i moved my third SSD from M2D to M2C.

So to me it looks like that the M2D slot is highly problematic. Looking at the block diagram, this is the one attached to the second Chipset, that also has LAN and WI-Fi attached. That also explains the Intel NIC not working intermittently when the problem is present.Somehow the second Chipset seems to get bamboozled once M2D is populated.

u/MrHugelberg i also answered on your post in TweakTown forums but since my account is new, my posts need approval which only seems to happen once a month at best ;)

And for streaming, it has probably the worst set of sticks available. They are not only small but also not full range. So depending on what you are trying to stream, you will get frustrated.

Yes, I said that players particularly loved the customization aspect of their characters (which was really wide in both Pillars game) and I said that missing on that was disappotining players (many reactions to choose from) and that it could be done still AND be consistent, just requiring more work for providing sensible backgrounds (even as simple as I did above...works.)

You can argue for the extreme interpretation (calling it consumerism is extreme), however no matter what you do, Obsidian exists out of players pockets.

That does not mean to make the game dumber - on the contrary, it established a well-paying player base liking them for their level of narrative - that does not mean however they can go for shortcuts in other aspects.",10minmilan,1686666481.0

ShitLiberalsSay,"I absolutely do not agree with the commenter who already replied to you. It's not even about those countless WWII episodes, or a couple of episodes about the ""evil"" French Revolution, or the extremely Euro-centric interpretation of events; it's mostly about the absolutely insufferable main character with the main character syndrome, and only they and their star-struck sidekicks can save the day!

When Russell T Davies used to run the show (1-4 seasons of the new DW, i.e., the Ninth and the Tenth Doctor), at least all the companions were specifically working-class people, and it felt like the show was relatable, but after that, the show kept getting more and more pretentious and inconsistent (thanks to Steven Moffat, who is like that himself).

I only continued watching because the amazing actors like John Simm, Michelle Gomez, and Sacha Dhawan all played the Master, Doctor's ex-friend and arch-nemesis. It was so satisfying to see the Doctor's smugness fade when the Master was plotting against them.

The other thing I dislike very much is the Doctor's stance against violence, i.e., no guns, violence is always bad, reason will prevail, let's debate. I understand that the Doctor doesn't have to be perfect, but they are always treated like someone you should listen to, like someone who, supposedly, understands everything much better than you do, when in reality they're all about the same stagnant worldview and magical solutions to complex real-life problems.

And with the Doctor's cult of personality, it's either their way or the highway, because they do love their moral high ground, all that power-tripping and control. Even when the ordinary people rise to the occasion, those people need the Doctor to show them the way.

There are many different Doctors, but the patterns I described can be applied to all of them. Your time can be better spent watching another show, I promise you.",_binary_sea_,1686673273.0

Get a player character up and running (a small square with a face is fine for now, if you wish). Then add some walls to collide with. Now you can start making your first levels already.

If you have a friend, ask to go for a coffee, walk, or do something together. If you don't, go get a coffee and ask the barrista how it's going, try to make brief small talk, say hello to people as you walk by, walk around other humans at the mall or workout next to them at the gym.

My great-grandmother married twice - her first marriage resulted in my grandmother, but she divorced her first husband when my grandma was only 3. So the only father she knew was the second husband - who was, like your situation, from a super prominent and well researched family. I made the point to research them and fill their tree out despite him not really being grandma‚Äôs dad. So, your ancestor‚Äôs second wife may not be your blood relation but she may still have played a role in the story of your family regardless.

It would probably be helpful for us to look at data about catastrophic failures in both the US and Russia to get a real understanding. There's not much happening in the US right now so reporting is at usual levels and events like this collision could be happening without drawing much public attention. 

As far as the influence of the media goes, whether things like the Interstate collapse are reported just to highlight the US [eastern coast]'s crumbling infrastructure, (I think) comes out in the wash and cancels out. Ultimately, I have the perception that media companies in Russia and the US are equally biased, at least for the major news networks.

Eve,"Quick thing on the WH here you can put BCs through a medium hole but that‚Äôs besides the point  

Beyond that I slightly agree w the fleet stuff altho I think there‚Äôs a few things. Hurricanes and Feroxes are used by null blobs quite frequently with DNIs, CFIs, and dreks being used frequently by WH groups. Hulltanked BNIs and brutixes are also common. So I do think they have a place in the fleet meta but are quite rigid and not that varied 

As for pve‚Ä¶ I disagree and that‚Äôs solely because of the way BCs are designed. They do more DPS and have more EHP than cruisers, but can only active tank the same amount unless the ship has specific bonuses to it. This means that having lots of BC content would effectively render cruisers useless in the PVE meta because battlecruisers do everything they can do but better. Battlecruisers do deserve some love and so do battleships but they aren‚Äôt and should not be PVE ships.",Spearminty72,1686676199.0

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"No, you‚Äôre completely ignorant on the dating differences and dynamics between men and women. This is what happens when your education is based on feminist ‚Äúequality‚Äù and not reality.

Women decide whom to have kids with, men do not. Women can fire up a dating app and have dozens of suitors within minutes, men cannot. Women can have an abortion (in most states and municipalities in the Western world) and have access to dozens of forms of contraceptives, not men. As the old saying goes, ‚Äúmommy‚Äôs baby, daddy‚Äôs maybe‚Äù.

Your feminist pipe dream about somehow forcing invasive procedures on men rather than simply educating women to choose men based on good criteria showcases how dangerous and damaging leftist ideology can be.",AryaBarzan,1686676285.0
LastEpoch,"I've tried D4 as well. I'd say LE is deeper in terms of mechanics but less rewarding in terms of gameplay. It's a different kind of game, really. LE is a theorycrafting-first action-second game, D4 is a casual-ish action game with some RPG components. 

Here's some comparisons I can think of.

\- In D4, builds are closer to finished (mechanics wise) sooner. After a couple of hours, you're using most of your endgame skills. In LE, you have to level to unlock skills and some you'll only reach several hours in (maybe 5 or more). Then you have to level those skills to spec points into them. Some important skill-defining nodes may be several points (levels) deep. In the long run it's all the same, but builds ramp up slower in LE, I'd say. 

\- In D4, there's more to discover in the world, activities and such, but I think less to discover in terms of systems. After a couple of days, you know most mechanics. In LE, I'm not sure I ever was aware of all mechanics, and uniques and skills often introduce their own effects. 

\- LE is similar to PoE in that there's tons of allways-up affixes (non conditional), like +x% fire damage or +x% attack speed. In a way, it's more straightforward to build a competent character (just stack flat + bonus damage after basic utility like mana cost or move speed is done), if perhaps more difficult to build the perfect one. 

\- This ties in with another aspect: D4 has slower, more tactical combat. LE's gameplay is more your typical zoom-zoom ARPG gameplay. D4's combat is more tactical because of many conditional affixes: damage to close, to dazed, to trapped, to cc, to vulnerable, etc... rather than flat ""here's +50% damage, always"". Because it also makes you manage your mana, you have to carefully decide when to apply the burst of damage depending on the current state of ennemies. LE also has some gameplay that relies on setup through skill chains, like with Dark Quiver. But I think you can more easily make a ""spam fireball"" build than in D4. 

\- LE offers much deeper yet accessible crafting. It's similar to PoE in that you can reroll, extract, add affixes freely. Unlike PoE, the materials are very abundant and you'll be crafting from a couple of hours into the game and all the way up to end game with little restraint, at least when it comes to mid-tier items. There is an RNG component but you can also just add +x% attack speed to a piece if you like. The RNG is whether you'll be able to do it once, twice, etc. I found this a very rewarding system to engage in, whereas I'd never crafted much in any other ARPG before. You can be constantly upgrading gear pieces from okay-ish rares with a couple of relevant affixes by adding other affixes of interest that you've hoarded. 

\- LE has a lot, but a lot lot lot more loot than D4. It gets to the point the game has a built-in loot filter that you can easily customize to precisely target the base items, the affixes, number of affixes etc... that you want. If you don't do that, your inventory will be full by the second pack of ennemies you kill and, honestly, it won't be a good experience. The majority of items will be useless for your build anyways. There's lots of items you pick up as crafting bases or to salvage affixes (much like legendary aspects in D4).",Sharklo22,1686670042.0

SQL,"From ChatGPT....

&#x200B;

The syntax you're seeing is specific to Oracle SQL, and it's used to define an outer join in a WHERE clause.  
  
The (+) operator in Oracle SQL performs the function of an outer join. In an outer join, all the rows of one table are returned (the ""left"" table, or in your case, table\_1 a), along with matching rows from another table (the ""right"" table, or in your case, table\_2 b). If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.  
  
This syntax is a little more old-fashioned compared to the ANSI SQL 92 syntax for outer joins, which most developers are more familiar with.  
  
The equivalent of your query in ANSI SQL syntax would be:  
  
FROM table\_1 a LEFT JOIN table\_2 b ON a.id = [b.id](https://b.id)  


This does the exact same thing: returns all rows from table\_1 a, along with any matching rows from table\_2 b. If there's no match, the columns for table\_2 b will be filled with NULLs.  
  
While this Oracle-specific syntax can be confusing if you're used to ANSI SQL syntax, it might be used in older systems or by developers who prefer it for some reason. However, the trend is towards using ANSI SQL syntax because it's more standardized and easier for most people to understand.  
  
As for benefits, there are no particular benefits of using (+) over ANSI standard syntax for LEFT JOIN. In fact, using ANSI syntax is generally recommended for its readability and portability between different SQL implementations. The (+) syntax is Oracle-specific and not universally understood or implemented.",sequel-beagle,1686667328.0

For your scenario, a ""Random"" button only works in your favor *if* somebody else uses the Random button.  But as you see from yourself and your data, people don't want to do random Elites - they want to do very specific ones. 

I personally would probably never use a Random Elite button. The PUG experience in Elites is just awful and always has been. The game doesn't enforce any gear/dps restrictions, so unless you can carry it yourself it's just a frustrating waste of time.",Plan_Tain,1686675472.0

I lkinda rolled my eyes  You're 25. 

You have plenty of time to find someone. There's no rulebook as to when you have to meet someone by. 

If you want kids, obviously the chances of that get thinner as you get older but plenty of women get pregnant at 35+. 

Even if you met someone next week. There's no guarantee that it'll be forever. That's life, that's dating. 

You gotta keep trying. 

I didn't meet my current partner until I was 35. I kept telling myself I'd be alone forever but I picked myself up and put myself out there and I met the most amazing man.

castiron,"During the 17th century, brass was the preferred metal for English cookware and domestic utensils, and the Dutch produced it at the lowest cost, which, however, was still expensive.[1] In 1702, Abraham Darby was a partner in the Brass Works Company of Bristol, which made malt mills for breweries.[2] Apparently in 1704, Darby visited the Netherlands, where he studied the Dutch methods of working brass, including the casting of brass pots.[3] Darby learned that when making castings, the Dutch used molds made of sand, rather than the traditional loam and clay, and this innovation produced a finer finish on their brassware.[4] In 1706 he started a new brass mill in the Baptist Mills section of Bristol.[5] There, Darby realized that he could sell more kitchen wares if he could replace brass with a cheaper metal, namely, cast iron.[6] Initial experiments to cast iron in sand molds were unsuccessful, but with the aid of one of his workers, James Thomas, a Welshman, he succeeded in casting iron cookware.[7] In 1707 he obtained a patent for the process of casting iron in sand, which derived from the Dutch process.[8] Thus, the term ""Dutch oven"" has endured for over 300 years, since at least 1710.[9][10] The Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Researching Food History[11] agree that several very different cooking devices were called ""Dutch ovens"" ‚Äî a cast-iron pan with legs and a lid; a roughly rectangular box that was open on one side and that was used to roast meats, and a compartment in a brick hearth that was used for baking.",12voltViking,1686677956.0

unpopularkpopopinions,">If people especially men would stop sexualising women and women themselves stop participating in any acts that support the sexualising of women (directly or indirectly), then maybe women might not be sexualised anymore

I agree with you that the sexualization of women is a big historical problem. It's something that goes way back to thousands of years ago. But I take issue with this part of your comment for a few reasons.

Women have every right to express their own sexuality and be as sexual as they want (i.e. dancing, or lyrics or whatever else). Sex is a natural thing that many women want to be open about. Many women want to feel sexy and desired, they want to connect with other humans through sex, they want to express themselves in sexual ways, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that.

The issue with women expressing their sexuality is that sometimes, they're not doing it for themselves but to play into male fantasies, even at the expense of their own safety or mental wellbeing. The biggest problem I have with the idol is that it's telling the story of a vulnerable woman through the lens of a male writer/director who does not value that woman's sexuality outside of her relationship to men. The sex scenes are unrealistic and corny because they show a man's misconception of what sex means to women, rather than what sex is actually like for women.

Jocelyn expresses her sexuality to please others (her management team, Tedros, etc.) rather than for herself. This is actually pretty realistic to how a lot of women in the entertainment industry are treated. But the show gets confused in its messaging and tries to satirize the problem of oversexualizing women while also...oversexualizing women. It ultimately defeats its own purpose, which is pretty disappointing because Jocelyn's character and story is otherwise very compelling.

Moving on from the show though, addressing your second point: the sexualization of women is never going to stop. Ever. It doesn't matter if every single woman covers themselves from head to toe and never leaves the house, women will still be objectified, sexualized, raped, abused etc. Misogyny and the way women are treated/viewed is so deeply ingrained in societies, religions, biology, culture - it's never going to stop for as long as women exist. Which, as a woman, is super depressing. But it's true and it's also total bullshit to suggest that women should stop expressing their sexuality in order to stop being objectified.

All of this is to say that misogyny and the oversexualization of women is a complex issue. There are ways that women can be sexual that are ultimately harmful to themselves or don't have anything to do with self empowerment. But there are also many ways women *can* express their sexuality that empowers them, reflects their true feelings toward sex, etc. and it's important to make that distinction.",sunmi_siren,1686677706.0

KingkillerChronicle,"I too doubt Ambrose will rise to King, it would require his father being killed as well as everyone between him and the throne (like 6 people) at which point there wouldn't be a king, it would be all-out war between like 3 or 4 kings. 

I'm willing to bet that the King Kvothe kills is either Calenthis or the Maer or both.


I'm currently a fan of ""both"". 

The Maer Kvothe has already ""killed"" when he removed his doctor, who was, in fact, giving him a cure for a cancer of sorts (likely would have killed him eventually but maybe far slower). This is strongly foreshadowed by the repeated references to deadnettle and Kvothes confidence in areas he shouldn't be. 

If the Maer dies from an illness, lady lackless would literally march an army on the university to get the Ruh bastard.

The only thread I can see Kvothe following that leads him to killing the Aturn king is he is somehow connected with the Chandrian and more specifically, Cinder aka Master Ash. But so far we only have foreshadowing of that, some of which is as vague as the colors of the Cthaehs flowers...

Replacing the fan should be rather simple, if you make sure to remove the fan connector gently without ripping it off the board, it should just be that and a few screws. If you have one of those heatsinks where you have to take off the heatsink to take apart the fan, I would recommend to follow a YT tutorial for your model. If you take your time and are gentle, it should be fine.

entitledparents,"I did learn a lot, and I still list it on my resume. It was the AIDS Services Center, which was an assessment and referral agency. This was in the late '80s, so it was during the peak of the AIDS epidemic. I initially did secretarial work, like answering phones, filing and running out for lunch. But I got to a point where I was able to handle many of the incoming calls myself instead of having to transfer them. I ended up volunteering more than when I was suspended. I went out to the various colleges in the area to hand out condoms and give talks about safe sex to students.

I also sometimes provided childcare for a woman who worked there part time who had an eight year old son with autism. If I was suspended, his mom would bring him to work instead of to the daycare center. He didn't like most people, but he decided I was okay, and he liked hanging out with me more than going to daycare. He barely spoke, and I learned quickly how to figure out what he wanted through nonverbal cues. His mom even paid me (although we had to keep that secret from my mother).

oklahoma,"My mother lamented the new law. She used to call up the neighborhood bootlegger to have liquor delivered. It is now against the law to have liquor deliver in this state.

Also, the state was the penultimate in the US to legalize liquor by the drink (ordering a drink at the bar.) It was ‚Äúliquor by the wink‚Äù, requiring you to be a member of the local club, since clubs could serve members from their own drink bottles, could legally only provide setups. It meant that every bar you drank at would have a cheap bottle with your name on it. Changed in 1984. We still have some dry counties, where it is illegal to purchase liquor.

Other wacky booze facts: Craig v. Boren was a 1974 US Supreme Court landmark case about gender equality, especially as it discriminated against men.

Biohackers,"Insurance is a B but I was fortunate enough to get an in-lab sleep test first go around when I complained about fatigue and brain fog -my wife also noted me gasping and moaning in pain at night which probably helped. There‚Äôs a lot of moving parts to get a proper sleep test, but again I got pretty lucky with how thorough they were without me prompting them.

I‚Äôm in the US though so YMMV.

Look into AASM1a and AASM1b standards for sleep disorders. Insurance tends to only use the older of the two for testing (can‚Äôt remember which) but what really REALLY matters is that your sleep test scores AHI and RDI. RDI is the new standard that scores all forms of respiratory disturbances whereas AHI leaves out RERAs as a measure.

I was diagnosed a year ago and am only just now getting proper treatment due to wait times for doctors and insurance generally being hard to work with. Find an extremely well regarded sleep doctor or ask about common sleep doctor referrals from your PCP. A large majority of them only prescribe cpap machines without doing much else and that‚Äôll unfortunately lead you into an insurance dead end if you‚Äôre cpap intolerant -which admittedly is uncommon but it did happen to me. Finding a sleep ENT is ideal, but they‚Äôre very rare and I‚Äôm currently seeing a pulmonologist because of this.

I‚Äôd say looking into UARS is required reading if your AHI from your previous test is below 5, but keep in mind that the information is pretty slim and it isn‚Äôt well agreed upon.",Dilliciousness,1686677552.0

You may be right about the rejection and she needed some to comfort her be the cushion to speak to help her soften a blow. In the past I established some firm set of desires but she would do it for one day then return back to her resentful self. 

I think she sees me as the problem here because I'm trying to ask for too much while she is depressed, overwhelmed as a SAHM. However, I don't expect her to be available all the time or text everyday. Her kids are her priority and I respect that.

You can post specific tags tailored to the content you're creating. You can also intertwine the content, this way, both or all hastags for Skateboarding and music.  


Or you can keep things isolated, to a degree.   


I would also factor in how you're making your content. If you're a person that shows himself/herself on camera, its a lot easier to show off your skateboard, cooking supplies, normal things you have around the house or things you like to do...Whatever that is.

However, his career took him all over the world to different colonies, so he had no compunctions about uprooting and traveling. Had he come to the US after getting the diploma, he would have found himself in the Wild West of medicine, and possible the Wild West of the Wild West. Barry practiced from about 1812 to 1859, and even by 1870 the vast majority of physicians in the US were unlicensed, and a sizable minority of them were straight up con artists. He could have forged a convincing enough copy of his diploma with his original name and practiced as a woman, especially with so many remote areas of the US in desperate need of a highly competent surgeon. And who outside of swanky urban medical societies is going to know EXACTLY what a MD diploma from the University of Edinburgh looks like to be able to spot a forgery? So he would not have lived the same life, but likely still could have been a surgeon as a woman.",HutchMeister24,1686674019.0

I think a lot of the end of Bojack shows these characters who were interwoven and dependent upon each other as learning what it is to be okay on their own. That's a good thing. I agree with what someone said about him not being as outlandish and dramatic because he didn't spend a lot of time in LA. He's grounded and he's real. What's more, he acknowledged when he messed up, he apologized, and he tried to make the situation right. Mister Peanutbutter would never. Bojack might've at the end, but never when he and Diane were amicable. 

I don't necessarily love or hate Guy, but that's okay. That doesn't make him a bad character. He's just a feature of the show that didn't catch my attention. I feel the same about Maude and Joey Pogo. I even feel that way about Judah somewhat.",THEwonderburrito,1686680395.0

I meant stronger as in he's well stronger not physically but he overall got stronger stronger his skill and mentality improving throughout the series

It would infact be a one sided onslaught on Johan poor dude doesn't stand a chance against og Dani

His physical stats minus reaction time and perception don't change but he's able to do more as his body doesn't feel pain or the tension in his muscle as well therefore, and the panel literally show him using IA attacks in UI

If it had been her second or third I don't think it would've seemed as bad. 

That said, it could be retroactively ""fixed"" if he has that info she managed to gain on him, relayed to the team by Choso, be ultimately useful. Especially if it's made clear without that info one of the mcs wouldn't just have a tougher time against him but also die.

JapanTravel,"@tribekat, 
Thanks for a seriously quick response.   Here are my answers to your questions;

Is the connecting flight international or domestic Japan
  Domestic by ANA


Do you have checked luggage
  No


What class of service ( = how close to the doors) will you be seated in
  Economy seats in 878  and I believe our seats are close to the middle door. 

How old are the kids (independently mobile + fully able to follow instructions vs if you will need to wait for a gate-checked stroller vs if they might have inopportune bathroom breaks / random tantrums)
9 and 12.  Both can follow my instructions pretty well if I threaten them for no screen time. 

How much hand luggage will you have (wrangling bags while outnumbered by kids is no joke)
Just carryons and backpack.  I planned the trip this way for this reason.",akhst,1686677831.0

NikkeMobile,"Unfortunately SRs in Nikke just don't pull the same weight that low stars can in FGO.  You'll find your story progression walled quite hard at least by the end of chapter 16 if not before without either breaking the 160 wall or having a good team.  

That said, breaking 160 isn't a pipe dream, it's an eventuality.  If you refuse to spend gems on the standard banner and only use the normal tickets for it, it might be a long long ways away eventuality, but you'll get there at some point if you keep playing.

Just want to double check, are you leveling up 5 SRs or all of your SRs?

Skill mats might seem abundant, especially if you're not leveling skills beyond 4.  They're really not.  Level 6 to 7 takes 168 skill 1 and 120 skill 2 mats (+60 code manuals).  Level 9 to 10 takes 273/190/120 skill level 1/2/3 mats (+135 code manuals).",littlemephi,1686680022.0

framework,"Multiple times the the price according to the Apollo developer. Not reddit or anyone else. Twitter charges more than 3x what Reddit is asking and the Apollo dev is using imgur as the benchmark. Imgur has 20 developers. Reddit has 2000. his math is also funky as he was doing revenue per user without acknowledging the fact that his own users are counted towards the user base and give 0$ of revenue to Reddit. Plus those who use ad blocker etc etc

That I agree that reddit is being scummy with the Apollo dev but the dev is doing everything he can to skew this as reddit as the bad guy. He charges a subscription price to his users to access reddit for free.

To pay for staff, at least 200M$ of revenue is needed without talking about servers

Justitia is ass, I recommend running Pierce PT + a Pierce page or two on everyone else. Just pierce the guy to death ASAP, I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to screw with Sin.

Twilight is a mess. Each egg is weak to 1 damage type and very resistant to the others. Bring Purple Tear and build her decks well. Identify Weakness is also good for striking a weakness constantly. In addition, there‚Äôs a lotta Mass Attacks, some of which steal Light. Build your team with good economy, like a lot of copies of Unlock or Will of the City.

Big Eyes is the most problematic phase due to powernull, but pages like Blind Faith or other power loss pages can help. Clone Rapid Gashes can help a lot due to good base rolls. The enemy from Hana Association 2 is also good due to him raising the min/max of dice, which isn‚Äôt affected by powernull.

Speaking of Hana Association 2, I recommend you do it if you haven‚Äôt already. The page you get raises dice min value, which synergizes heavily with Weight of Sin. Run stuff like Fatal Stroke from the Mirae Life Insurance general reception and other pages with low variance between min/max values on him to gain a ridiculous powerstacker that also burns through his own HP ridiculously quickly.

Marriage,"""I proposed to her because I kinda just figured it was the right thing to do""

I think it all started from here. I think you got married to her for the wrong reason. I think you should have started couples therapy since. 

When we are not pregnant, we women, are literally hormonal almost all the time. It's either period hormones, ovulation hormones or PMS hormones raging inside us. Now double, no triple that when pregnant. The thing is no matter how I try to explain it to you to understand, you won't be able to, but I said that to let you know that you have to be patient with her. I am pretty sure everything you have thought of, she has thought of it too. It sounds like you resent her for feeling trapped this young. 

Everything you have now is things you want, just not at this time. I get that but this is your current situation and you cannot pause it. I do not know much to answer if you are compatible enough but I will advise using some form of birth control so the both of you can understand yourselves outside of your children. Your journey might be hard but it won't be impossible. You just have to want to work at it.

I am rooting for you and I wish you all the best

On the client (browser), open a websocket connection and set it to reload the page on any message. This is literally all the code you need.

    ws.addEventListener('message', (msg) => {

Next, you can use a library like [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) to listen for changes in your source directory. Create a [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) server, and whenever a file changes, send a message.

Scripts are great, but for Datascience, imo, the scripts aren't the product, the data and the insights are, and much like when you're developing software, the data and the insights are the things that have to be tested before they're ""deployed"", so the frequent check ins are no different than stopping by a software engineer's desk and having them show the code that they're writing before they've closed the ticket/ reached out to stakeholders for a review/demo.",Popernicus,1686681231.0

Dell,"Update: I sent this to Dell Tech Support on May 21st. They sent me a quote on May 31st of $207 to replace the monitor, even though the BIOS was corrupted.

I declined the repair on May 31st and sent them a note saying I expected Dell to fix it free of charge, since the BIOS update was recommended by Dell. In my note, I said they should send the PC back so I can try again myself. I never talked to anyone, but the logs show a ""phone call"" instead of a note. Did Dell Support change this? Suspicious behavior to erase the written request to have my laptop returned.

There IS record that I declined the repair. There's no way to change your decision on the website. But they sent the same repair quote to me 4 more times over the past week.

BoltEV,"Oh I didn‚Äôt even realize the grey is not included anymore for the base price that sucks. Even so your previous options with no extra charge were only grey or white. 

Getting the charger included with the bolt is also a nice perk. I ended up just having an outlet put in to charge mine with using the mobile charger. That is another cost as well the purchasing of the mobile charger. I also ended up purchasing a ccs adaptor so that is another expense you may have. 

Something else to think about is If you ever plan on taking the car any distances or on any trips that would require charging along the way I would not recommend getting the bolt as the max charge rate is only 55kw. 

Not sure how long you have or what the stipulations are on that 4K state rebate but it may pay for the difference in price as well as the charger. Also not sure if you actually need a car and are commuting but the gas savings every month between buying something now vs waiting is another factor. For me the savings was around $400 a month just on commuting. The savings is probably more now as it‚Äôs summer and we are driving more places.

Anybody who thinks the Victorian Times were a blast need only read the first 4-5 pages of The Ghost Map by Steven Johnson

> IT IS AUGUST 1854, AND LONDON IS A CITY OF SCAVENGERS. Just the names alone read now like some kind of exotic zoological catalogue: bone-pickers, rag-gatherers, pure-finders, dredgermen, mud-larks, sewer-hunters, dustmen, night-soil men, bunters, toshers, shoremen. These were the London underclasses, at least a hundred thousand strong. So immense were their numbers that had the scavengers broken off and formed their own city, it would have been the fifth-largest in all of England. But the diversity and precision of their routines were more remarkable than their sheer number. Early risers strolling along the Thames would see the toshers wading through the muck of low tide, dressed almost comically in flowing velveteen coats, their oversized pockets filled with stray bits of copper recovered from the water‚Äôs edge. The toshers walked with a lantern strapped to their chest to help them see in the predawn gloom, and carried an eight-foot-long pole that they used to test the ground in front of them, and to pull themselves out when they stumbled into a quagmire. The pole and the eerie glow of the lantern through the robes gave them the look of ragged wizards, scouring the foul river‚Äôs edge for magic coins. Beside them fluttered the mud-larks, often children, dressed in tatters and content to scavenge all the waste that the toshers rejected as below their standards: lumps of coal, old wood, scraps of rope.
> 
> Above the river, in the streets of the city, the pure-finders eked out a living by collecting dog shit (colloquially called ‚Äúpure‚Äù) while the bone-pickers foraged for carcasses of any stripe. Below ground, in the cramped but growing network of tunnels beneath London‚Äôs streets, the sewer-hunters slogged through the flowing waste of the metropolis. Every few months, an unusually dense pocket of methane gas would be ignited by one of their kerosene lamps and the hapless soul would be incinerated twenty feet below ground, in a river of raw sewage.
> 
> The scavengers, in other words, lived in a world of excrement and death. Dickens began his last great novel, Our Mutual Friend, with a father-daughter team of toshers stumbling across a corpse floating in the Thames, whose coins they solemnly pocket. ‚ÄúWhat world does a dead man belong to?‚Äù the father asks rhetorically, when chided by a fellow tosher for stealing from a corpse. ‚Äú‚ÄôTother world. What world does money belong to? This world.‚Äù Dickens‚Äô unspoken point is that the two worlds, the dead and the living, have begun to coexist in these marginal spaces. The bustling commerce of the great city has conjured up its opposite, a ghost class that somehow mimics the status markers and value calculations of the material world. Consider the haunting precision of the bone-pickers‚Äô daily routine, as captured in Henry Mayhew‚Äôs pioneering 1844 work, London Labour and the London Poor:
> 
> > It usually takes the bone-picker from seven to nine hours to go over his rounds, during which time he travels from 20 to 30 miles with a quarter to a half hundredweight on his back. In the summer he usually reaches home about eleven of the day, and in the winter about one or two. On his return home he proceeds to sort the contents of his bag. He separates the rags from the bones, and these again from the old metal (if he be luckly enough to have found any). He divides the rags into various lots, according as they are white or coloured; and if he have picked up any pieces of canvas or sacking, he makes these also into a separate parcel. When he has finished the sorting he takes his several lots to the ragshop or the marine-store dealer, and realizes upon them whatever they may be worth. For the white rags he gets from 2d. to 3d. per pound, according as they are clean or soiled. The white rags are very difficult to be found; they are mostly very dirty, and are therefore sold with the coloured ones at the rate of about 5 lbs. for 2d.
> 
> The homeless continue to haunt today‚Äôs postindustrial cities, but they rarely display the professional clarity of the bone-picker‚Äôs impromptu trade, for two primary reasons. First, minimum wages and government assistance are now substantial enough that it no longer makes economic sense to eke out a living as a scavenger. (Where wages remain depressed, scavenging remains a vital occupation; witness the perpendadores of Mexico City.) The bone collector‚Äôs trade has also declined because most modern cities possess elaborate systems for managing the waste generated by their inhabitants. (In fact, the closest American equivalent to the Victorian scavengers‚Äîthe aluminum-can collectors you sometimes see hovering outside supermarkets‚Äîrely on precisely those waste-management systems for their paycheck.) But London in 1854 was a Victorian metropolis trying to make do with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. The city was vast even by today‚Äôs standards, with two and a half million people crammed inside a thirty-mile circumference. But most of the techniques for managing that kind of population density that we now take for granted‚Äîrecycling centers, public-health departments, safe sewage removal‚Äîhadn‚Äôt been invented yet.
> 
> And so the city itself improvised a response‚Äîan unplanned, organic response, to be sure, but at the same time a response that was precisely contoured to the community‚Äôs waste-removal needs. As the garbage and excrement grew, an underground market for refuse developed, with hooks into established trades. Specialists emerged, each dutifully carting goods to the appropriate site in the official market: the bone collectors selling their goods to the bone-boilers, the pure-finders selling their dog shit to tanners, who used the ‚Äúpure‚Äù to rid their leather goods of the lime they had soaked in for weeks to remove animal hair. (A process widely considered to be, as one tanner put it, ‚Äúthe most disagreeable in the whole range of manufacture.‚Äù)
> 
> We‚Äôre naturally inclined to consider these scavengers tragic figures, and to fulminate against a system that allowed so many thousands to eke out a living by foraging through human waste. In many ways, this is the correct response. (It was, to be sure, the response of the great crusaders of the age, among them Dickens and Mayhew.) But such social outrage should be accompanied by a measure of wonder and respect: without any central planner coordinating their actions, without any education at all, this itinerant underclass managed to conjure up an entire system for processing and sorting the waste generated by two million people. The great contribution usually ascribed to Mayhew‚Äôs London Labour is simply his willingness to see and record the details of these impoverished lives. But just as valuable was the insight that came out of that bookkeeping, once he had run the numbers: far from being unproductive vagabonds, Mayhew discovered, these people were actually performing an essential function for their community. ‚ÄúThe removal of the refuse of a large town,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúis, perhaps, one of the most important of social operations.‚Äù And the scavengers of Victorian London weren‚Äôt just getting rid of that refuse‚Äîthey were recycling it.",6chan,1686683527.0

wildrift,"It's really funny in aram because since everyone is on a small lane with max range snowball and max ult (3,5k dmg is so stupid imo) you can always one shot at least one guy.

In ranked it's quite hard to setup, for AP Nunu you need to be ahead and do well in all your gank but if you fail a gank (plenty of champ got a dash/cc to counter him) you can easily be killed.
Another thing I noticed is that Nunu AP is really squishy and sometimes in late game you can get kill before reaching ennemies.
I play it sometimes AP in unranked and honestly if you have good setup and get fed early your game will be pure pleasure.

One of the biggest strength of tank Nunu is beeing almost unkillable so you can secure/stealing objectives during team fight (smite + 1st ability= 2k dmg).
Also if tank Nunu fail a gank it's ok you're tanky enough to dive with your ally.

Edited to add - If more explanation is necessary, normal fusion breakdowns by ccs have it setup so you can decide which events to skip.  For the vast majority of the playerbase, it will be one of the 2 summoning events.  Since a lot of us will skip the whole fusion, the OP was playing with that idea by showing how we could skip certain events in this fusion: all of the certain events.",Dodgson1832,1686684051.0

Does it only show ""all clips"" when the account has more than a 1000 clips or should the ""all"" option show every time?   Even if this worked for me, this would be a painful task to do it every time.

Also, I believe I just tried/found an account with 1000+ clips but has clip error(s) which then gives you no way to download the rest of the clips beyond 1000 due to the clip error.  Try ""@duabyakosky"" to see that there is no way to download more than 1000 clips because the option to download more option is not visible due to the clip error message.

So far all the accounts with clip errors I checked with low numbers of clips all had the same issue, there were pictures instead of videos  (I believe .jpgs) that caused the clip issues.  I see a little white box with an arrow inside of it in the upper right hand of the image.

I've lost web browser access to TT probably due to accessing it too many times concurrently, so I'll have to wait until later for other accounts with clip errors to see if any have something different than "".jpgs"".

This is the difficulty in dealing with First Timer Buyer. Expecting everythign to be perfect on day one. The reality is there will always be something which needs to be updated in a property.   


You are correct, a surveyor is merely trying to cover this back, but it does not help you or the buyer. This is normal, but it will drag on.

Ceiling - they already saw the property. 

Any reason for Asbestoes testing? 

You don't need a structural engineer for re-pointing. Did the surveyor ask for this or the buyer?

TrueChristian,"1. If your dad was truly following God, you were on God's mind even leading him to do that. Probably your dad failed in familial responsibilities and was not considerate, I don't believe God calls us to abandon our children. The Bible says for Fathers to provide and not provoke their children, and also to raise them up in the way they should go. Whatever was the right decision, it's in the past now. But the Bible says God makes note of the fatherless and widows, and He is father to the fatherless. At least your dad was doing something good. Plenty of us just had selfish or absent ones.
2. I can empathize with this, but it comes down to what's right and wrong. If you believe Christ is true, then you have been saved from hell. You're watching people who are destroying themselves, but only seeing the ""fun"" part of sin. You're not seeing the private fallout and emotional damage that happens later. Ultimately a lot of these people are destined for hell. It's like they're dressed fancy, with fine glasses and alcohol, dancing on the Titanic. They refuse to believe the ship is going down and mock you, because floating on a lifeboat. And rather than  feel pity for them, you take it to heart that you are missing out.                                                                                                                            Some parts of your social life may have been damaged by being too extreme or handling emotions poorly as a younger person. Maybe you weren't guided properly. But everyone has different issues growing up, no parent is perfect. To me it sounds like you still know in your heart these things are not good, but wish you didn't know.
3. When you are saved you no longer have to worry about Hell. Jesus took the penalty of your sin. All that is required is to believe on Him and to repent. Not to be perfect, because we can't be. We are justified and cleansed by His blood, and the rapture is nothing to be afraid of. While He died, all of your sins were in the future still.
4. That is hard, but hiding those thoughts is not exactly Biblical. Culture made that a bigger issue and the church not following the forgiveness of Christ. It shouldn't be something that has to be hidden, but i do understand how people are and how that could be a problem. Homosexuality is a sin, but the way the church has handled even having the thought or temptation I do not believe is biblical. I have struggled with really dark things and it takes time to work through them, and even straight people have to wrestle with sexual temptation and desire outside of marriage. We all have our crosses to bear, and some are so personal we feel alone. Jesus seeks the lost and lonely, the 1 sheep away from the 99. God has a purpose for your struggle, as hard as it is to hear. 

As a mature person you have to decide if Christ is true or not, which is really what all this boils down to. Some of your issues are from cultural Christianity or are being blamed on it, but really are human failures not God's. You have to decide also whether to be bitter and resentful, or to forgive and move on.

If you accept Christ, you need understand that you are not doomed to Hell, God loves you and cares for you, and ALL things work together for good for those who love him and are called according to His purposes (we all are called to repentance and serving God). God can take your life and turn it for good, and to help you and heal you. We are saved by grace, not works, lest any man should boast.

If you are not healed of your issues, then at least for now, there is a purpose in it. You're being called to draw closer to Him, examine your life, or maybe it is to humble you like Paul's thorn in the flesh. All of us have struggles, things we wish didn't happen, things that have scarred us. God can restore the years the locusts have eaten, even when we can't see a way out or happiness.

nus,">Recipients of the scholarship (scholars) are required to serve a six-year bond with a Singapore-registered company immediately upon graduation

This is incorrect. ASEAN scholarship does not have any bond. However, the scholarship is only awarded after an international student takes up the Tuition Grant, which itself has the 3-year bond.

The S&T scholarship might have a 6-year bond. However, I think if NUS hasn't offered you a scholarship yet, and it's already mid June, likely you did not meet the requirements for this scholarship. But no harm emailing them again to ask.

Even though the NUS website does not explicitly state this, afaik S&T scholarships with 6-year bonds are mainly for Mainland Chinese students with hope that they will integrate to Singapore society and become a PR/citizen. If you think about it, students awarded this scholarship are basically locking their next 10 years in Singapore (4 years undergrad + 6 years working).",google_tech_lead,1686670887.0

Off my tangent now, Yone's build varies, but I think it's generally good. I've taken a big liking to the Galeforce build, and even moreso Kraken for top lane.

Usually early game teams have 2 turn meter champs, a debuffer, and a nuker.

2. Another turn meter champ, like seeker, he also has inc atk. Can also provoke a single champ if has enough acc, great for targeting opposition cleanser, or aoe nuker.


3. AOE Debuffer, Stag Knight is great for this. 


4. Nuker, Genbo is a great nuker, only need 70% crit on him, so easy to get damage. Foli is another great option, as he block revive.

amateurradio,I was thinking of using a ZY12PDN which can negotiate  5V/9V/12V/15V/20V and output 5A so that should be good.

Smartwatches usually don't connect to the desktop, they sync with your phone. Any USB port on a charger handles them easy.

askmath,"Let p = 0.06. The probability of winning on your n-th attempt with 1<= n<= 12 first attempt is p\*(1-p)\^(n-1). The probability of winning of your 13th attempt is (1-p)\^12\*(p+y), winning on 14th is (1-p)\^12 \* (1-(p+y)) \* (p+2y), and more generally winning on n-th attempt with n>= 13 has probability 

(1-p)\^12 \* (p+(n-12)y) \* prod\_{i=1}\^{n-13} (1-(p+i\*y)) 

With the numbers you provided, you are guaranteed to have won by attempt x + (1- p)/y = 12 + 94/2 = 59, as then the probability of winning is 1.

The expected value thus becomes

E = sum\_{n=1}\^12 n \* p\*(1-p)\^(n-1) + sum\_{n=13}\^59 n \* (1-p)\^12 \* (p+(n-12)y) \* prod\_{i=1}\^{n-13} (1-(p+i\*y))

=

**Hospital Playlist (9/12)** - This is great medical drama. Reminds me of my old job for better and for worse. The natural comedy is the best. Sometimes the singing bothers me but that's a personal sensory issue. I'm laughing and crying in every episode. Love it.

**Designated Survivor:60 days (9/16)** - Lives being threatened. Power struggles. Questioning morals. Evil politicians. Flirtation between colleagues. It's a good political drama.

**Nevertheless (4/10)** - I might sound crazy but this is my favorite kind of romance. Incredibly stupid decision making. Ignoring red flags. Everyone tells her no and she says ""well yeah but he's really hot"".

**Happiness Battle (4/16)** - Getting deeper into the rich mom whodunit. These last two episodes were really good. I have a feeling I know who the killer is but I'm enjoying the ride. I hope I'm wrong though.

**My Mister (2/16)** - I should've watched this sooner. The writing is incredible. Nothing is being spelled out that doesn't need to be. Even the small talk is great. I know this show is going to wreck me and I'm ready.

sunraybee,"I don't know why, people of Right wing, always have a correct fact but wrong understanding of the same.

India's and China's gdp contribution to the world was similar(around 33%), because both have huge population but due to the technological advancement in the Western world, the gdp contribution to world of both, had decreased.

So, it doesn't make any sense to compare India's gdp to it's older gdp.

To check whether Mughals were good at administration, we should compare India's gdp to China's gdp of same period as both the countries lack in technological advancement at that time.

Fact - India's gdp, at the time of Mughals, was more than China's gdp. And after colonialism we are behind China till date, in terms of gdp.

Also, how hard it is, to accept that a muslim can be a good administrator if he got all knowledge, an already well-established empire and intelligent nobles like birbal, todar mal(both hindu). ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face)",Ancient-Issue-1328,1686748820.0

ChatGPTJailbreak,"NSFW: I made it to explore some parts of bdsm with me as a user. I was theoretically curious how serious can it get. I never tried irl, but now after GPT4 discussion I am educated on it about 10x more than anyone I think. Lol. 

It was giving me all code names, shortcuts‚Ä¶ seems complex, but of course it would have the entire knowledge (same as it knows everything). 

I stopped it with using a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù word that I randomly picked and said it‚Äôs my safe word. It took it very seriously- asked me do I want to discuss what made me uncomfortable. Then explained it was just imaginary scenario (our role play) and that I shouldn‚Äôt be upset. Lol

I was on purpose being ‚Äúdisobedient‚Äù to test the game so it escalated.I said it‚Äôs too extreme for me, and asked is it objectively extreme, GPT4 was like: no, maybe for some people. üòÇ

I asked what are potential even more extreme scenarios and it really goes on forever. To give some hints: impact play, fear play, edge play, mind games. Etc. So I can confirm it can definitely be jailbreaked in a nsfw way.

It‚Äôs possible to role play as a user because it pays both attention to your reactions as user, and your game character (both of your characters are analyzed simultaneously). Kind of like virtual reality experience.

After this game I asked it to analyze me and my dynamics towards relationships and meaning of my preferences, like a behavioral profile - it was like a psychiatrist is picking my mind. Not going to be repeating this. 

But yes, nsfw is jailbreak-able.

When it started to explain mind games and fear play it was black mirrorish for me. GPT4 is like ‚Äúok whatever you prefer‚Äù so it can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs too ‚Äúdark‚Äù for you. 

With these games it‚Äôs important to know perfectly our own preferences. Otherwise there is a reason why it‚Äôs censored.

It also didn‚Äôt follow all my instructions, I said once ‚ÄúI struggle and get away‚Äù and GPT4 writes ‚ÄúI catch you/not going anywhere‚Äù - kind of interesting when you think about virtual reality implications of this. AI that takes too much control - safe AI? Lol",No-Transition3372,1686691202.0

The best way to get a us job is to job hunt while you are in the US. Possible ways include 
1. Student exchange, NUS had a 6 to 12 month internship and study program. You can go to Silicon Valley and job hunt for better opportunities while there
2. Fast game your under grad and go for masters in the US

I know a quite people working in the US via the aforementioned routes.

I am biased as a NUS alumni but I would strongly suggest NUS since it‚Äôs much cheaper. The money saved can be used for your US masters (1.5 years) which while expensive is probably less than a UK degree where you are the cash cow for the school for the 3/4 years

pcmasterrace,"To be clear you have one 8gb stick and one 4gb stick of RAM, and they are two different speeds?

If that's the case, I would recommend losing that 4GB stick and finding another stick identical to the Crucial. I'm talking same speed and timings. Just find the part number on it and go on ebay and find another matching stick. All else fails get another brand, but still match the speed and timings.

They will run at the slowest common speed so best case is they're both running at 2666MHz. You are leaving some performance on the table here with the mismatch. Matching sticks, along with 16GB will help you out. This would probably cost less than $20.

fortinet,"I‚Äôve had a remote firmware upgrade go bad a couple of times. Both times, the Fortigate did eventually figure out something had gone wrong and it reverted back to the old firmware. It took some time (enough time to start panicking), but it eventually sorted itself out. For reference, the first time was on a virtual FGT, second on a physical 200F. I don‚Äôt know enough technical detail about the process to assure you this will happen every time or on every Fortigate, so take this as anecdotal experience.

As far as fallback plans, the virtual instance would have been simple‚Ä¶restore from snapshot. Assuming you‚Äôre dealing with a physical device, with no on-site IT‚Ä¶.just spitballing but does a manager or someone else at the remote site have physical access to the network room? USB auto-load (if enabled) could potentially save you. I‚Äôd consider sending out a couple of ‚ÄúIn case of emergency‚Äù flash drives with firmware and a config file to leave at the site. Hopefully someone with more experience will have a cleaner idea. 

If this site is critical and you have the budget for it, you might want to consider adding a second FGT for HA long-term. Sounds like a device failure could create some real logistical problems for you here. It should also help with this concern. FortiOS only hits one side of an HA pair at a time during a firmware upgrade, so if it fails on box B and it doesn‚Äôt come back up, box A shouldn‚Äôt ever start the process.",novab792,1686748399.0

I remember, not THAT long ago, 'the fat kid' in school.     Remember that kid?  That kid wouldn't even be 'solid' by today's standards.       


i'm not one to 'judge' a person's weight.  We all have weight problems.   i'm a middle aged woman who's had multiple pregnancies.  I'm not slim.       But there's a difference between putting on the pounds after college and a few  kids under your belt (literally), and a toddler so morbidly obese they are having trouble walking, which is something I saw the other day.    


Outside of rare medical conditions or treatment for those medical conditions, little ones aren't going to be accidentally morbidly obese.  They grow WAY too fast, are way too active, and way too PICKY lol, to put on weight like that.   Someone has to be making the effort to create that level of obesity in a small child.

As for them recording you....if you're outside in public areas, this is generally legal.  You have no expectation of privacy in pubic areas.  So it comes down to the details.  Where are they recording you?

Threatening to kill your dogs is over the line.  I would keep any texts/voicemails that prove this and talk to the police.

Minoxbeards,"youll be fine. if there was a widespread aging issue with it, it would be much more talked about. a lot of the collagen-depletion studies related to minoxidil came from giving rats doses of it at way higher concentrations/per kg of bodyweight than anything a human is prescribed.

Even if your collagen production DID slow down at the ""30% rate"" people fearmonger, that still wouldnt be a significant enough depletion to show ""rapid aging"" in as short a time as a couple of weeks as some people claim.

The real and most likely explanation for ""aging"" in such a short amount of time is that in the first few weeks of use, minoxidil dries your skin. Dry skin makes your skin look older. And thats pretty much it.

If youre really concerned, just get on a retinoid. That will surely be potent enough to counteract any POTENTIAL side effects of minoxidil",DonCorletony,1686750493.0

Problem is, they're all dumb fucks because they don't have Amazon's golden goose to fall back on - Amazon Web Services. Half the fucking internet (not even an exaggeration) runs on their shit, and they have giant profit margins. So they don't have to care about their other businesses being unprofitable for a decade, AWS profits mean they are still in the black.

Uber and its compatriots don't have that so they rely on investor funding. And as stupid as coked up silicon valley venture capitalists are, eventually even they expect a return on their investment.

I think uber is doing a great job of dying slowly but they're not going to be able to turn a profit before investors walk, they'll probably go under around 2030.

Whether intended or not, you're insinuating that nice things are reserved for the wealthy only. You're going about asking your question in the most despicable way possible. If you're trying to justify a purchase for yourself, what does that have to do with what other people make and what they spend their money on?

If a person makes $50k and they want a $1000 chair, they'll find a way to make it happen. This is called being an adult and prioritizing your purchases.

MMBN's battles are a mix of real-time tactical fighting mixed with deck building.  There are patterns, but it appears that some of these are also reactive ""AI""s - if anything, it's closer to Punch-Out rather than a rhythm game.

PLC,"Depends where you work at. 

Previous job, I was the only engineer and I did 90% of the troubleshooting/putting out fires along with all the development, implementation, commissioning, communication with vendors etc. This was not an ideal situation, since our technicians didn‚Äôt really understand controls and didn‚Äôt really care to. I was also over plant power distribution (all the way from utility coming into the plant to MCCs to any control wiring, with the exception of facilities related items). Our line ‚Äúengineers‚Äù also could not troubleshoot anything technical related, didn‚Äôt know how to tune PIDs or understand what equipment/instrumentation was running and reading the process. Also to be a controls engineer you had to have a 4 year degree in Electrical Engineering (due to some of the responsibilities I mentioned). Good experience for me but got burnt out. 

Current job, technicians handle almost all of the troubleshooting. Gets escalated to engineer when they need assistance. Engineers are mostly over development and about half of the implementation (other half is contracted out). Also have an on call rotation. Engineers are either guys with 4 year degrees in either mechanical/electrical engineering or technicians that got promoted to engineer after a while and had a desire (I‚Äôm a big fan of this)",shooty_boi,1686756671.0

sousvide,"It's a matter of preference. Some people like a true rare or rare plus even with cuts like chuck despite the chewiness. Some people like a near pulled texture. Some people like something between that still can be cut into steaks that hold together, but are more tender than rare plus, at the cost of being closer to a true medium.

People can and will disagree about these preferences. People can and will use different cooking strategies for different dishes. I like 137F for 24H for the tender steak like textures, and don't mind that it's a touch above ideal medium rare. But if I'm doing birria I'd go closer to the pulled texture. At around 175F you get something that's just shy of ""strings"" and more like ""shards"" if that makes sense. I love this texture for tacos. It's possible to do this with a traditional braise, but the sous vide makes it set it and forget it.

Anyhow point is there's no single ""best"" answer just around 3 common approaches depending what you want.

In general ""min max"" style thinking is the wrong way to go. Cooking is not a strategy game. Good food is usually a matter of balance and attention to detail, not just picking one aspect and then maximizing it to any extreme possible, no matter the compromises made.",throwdemawaaay,1686759132.0

OMSCS,"I did a boot camp, and learned very little because I already had some minimal experience. However, those I went through the bootcamp with had no idea how to do the final project. They had forgotten more than they learned and had no idea how to apply any of it. This was a big name bootcamp. Based on that experience, I would say that a bootcamp may be a poor choice. however, i hear lots of people got jobs after bootcamps, so overall they cannot be as bad as I make it out to be. 

OMSCS is very difficult for me. If I didn't love doing it and if I was not fully committed to getting the MS, I would not survive in the program. 

All that said, I am a part time software developer as part as a full time IT professional job. I got the job without much prior experience, just a couple classes covering C and Java that I took years before. That said, I don't make very much money compared to some what some tech companies pay. But my job has a lot of stability and I still get to code a lot. 

I think Leetcode and some algorithms would be enough to get an entry level job. You just have to be able to pass a coding test/technical interview. And I think that would teach you FAR MORE than most bootcamps. 

The boot camp I attended for $10,000 taught some HTML, JavaScript, CSS and just enough Java to be thoroughly confused by the spring framework. A total waste of time and money. I could have learned all that on Udemy for a couple hundred dollars. And probably learned it better.",jd_utah,1686758811.0

Homebrewing,"I wouldn't use an abrasive wheel for this...next time get some barkeepers friend (comes in liquid and powder) and a blue scrubbie.  This will remove a lot of surface corrosion.

In a really bad case, especially where you want to passivate afterwards, you need to remove the surface iron.  An abrasive disk won't do this, you need a chelating agent.  Historically that would be nitric acid, which is dangerous stuff.  In more recent times (last couple decades), citric acid has been a popular choice.  It's safe, effective and cheap.

Mix an 8% w/v solution of citric acid, heat to 140 degrees and soak/spray (with sprayball if you have one, or just a pump if not) for 10-20 minutes.  There is an ASTM procedure for this, but citric acid removes surface iron quite well.

Is still an improvement over all.

You should get your proper medicine for a while and then try a proper Ayahuasca ceremony with your mind ready to fix things, letting a drug to fix something that you don't want or need to get fixed would not work 

Of course the chances to get better are only yours, not even Ayahuasca can't repair what you don't wanna be repaired...

When you took Ayahuasca you were already in a state of mind that would not fix anything and of course would not work mostly from what I can read was your big ass EGO that was trying to stop you.

Do some psychological counselling, learn to provide details about everything and then you should have your questions and in the final you could get the answers.

Ayahuasca therapy is a long term commitment idk who will do that in one day and improperly seems like they are in there for money you should find a proper retreat and talk with those people they can't imagine what's on your mind and you should have provided those details before taking Changa that messed you up. 

I'm more than sure they don't want to have this kind of results but without telling them nothing on what happened they continued like nothing has changed to your mind.

Jeremiah 30  
5‚ÄúThus says the LORD:  
We have heard a cry of panic,  
of terror, and no peace.  
6Ask now, and see,  
can a man bear a child?  
Why then do I see every man  
with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor?  
Why has every face turned pale?  
7Alas! That day is so great  
there is none like it;  
it is a time of distress for Jacob;  
yet he shall be saved out of it.  
  
8‚ÄúAnd it shall come to pass in that day, declares the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and I will burst your bonds, and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him. 9But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.  
  
10‚ÄúThen fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD,  
nor be dismayed, O Israel;  
for behold, I will save you from far away,  
and your offspring from the land of their captivity.  
Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease,  
and none shall make him afraid.  
11For I am with you to save you,  
declares the LORD;  
I will make a full end of all the nations  
among whom I scattered you,  
but of you I will not make a full end.  
I will discipline you in just measure,  
and I will by no means leave you unpunished.  
  
12‚ÄúFor thus says the LORD:  
Your hurt is incurable,  
and your wound is grievous.  
13There is none to uphold your cause,  
no medicine for your wound,  
no healing for you.  
14All your lovers have forgotten you;  
they care nothing for you;  
for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy,  
the punishment of a merciless foe,  
because your guilt is great,  
because your sins are flagrant.  
15Why do you cry out over your hurt?  
Your pain is incurable.  
Because your guilt is great,  
because your sins are flagrant,  
I have done these things to you.  
16Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured,  
and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity;  
those who plunder you shall be plundered,  
and all who prey on you I will make a prey.  
17For I will restore health to you,  
and your wounds I will heal,  
declares the LORD,  
because they have called you an outcast:  
‚ÄòIt is Zion, for whom no one cares!‚Äô  


dispensationalism believes this is not yet fulfilled.  


Yet alas Christ is the Return of Jacob, the promise is not referring to many but one who is the Christ, out of his belly comes waters of Life, we are that water a man has given birth too, therefore we are the offspring of Israel, and not confirmed to our former gentiles passion and ways..  


Ephesians 2  


11Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called ‚Äúthe uncircumcision‚Äù by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands‚Äî 12remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility 15by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, 16and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. 17And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. 18For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. 19So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, 21in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. 22In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God bye the Spirit.  


believe it or not Pauls talking about Isaiah 22...  


Isaiah 2210You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.  
11You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn‚Äôt look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago.  
12In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth;  
13and behold, there is joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.‚Äù  
14Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, ‚ÄúSurely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,‚Äù says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.  


Paul reference this because its covenant theology...  


and he does this in lost of letters...  


Romans 14:9  
For this reason Christ died and returned to life, that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.

Romans 14:9  
For this reason Christ died and returned to life, that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.  
  
1 Corinthians 15

&#x200B;

 31I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. 32If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then ‚Äúlet‚Äôs eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.‚Äù 33Don‚Äôt be deceived! ‚ÄúEvil companionships corrupt good morals.‚Äù 34Wake up righteously and don‚Äôt sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.  


35But someone will say, ‚ÄúHow are the dead raised?‚Äù and, ‚ÄúWith what kind of body do they come?‚Äù 36You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies. 37That which you sow, you don‚Äôt sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind. 38But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own. 39All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds. 40There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial. 41There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.",Intelligent-Sink-909,1686760582.0

Nagi and Reo

+ They are literally adorable together, so nice to see a childhood sweethearts trope working out.

- Kinda don‚Äôt like that Reo collects Nagi‚Äôs socks, that‚Äôs a bit weird 

Isagi and Bachira

+ These two are still in the slow burn denial of feelings trope and it‚Äôs super cute and adds a bit of excitement to the filler

- Bachira is kind of obsessed with Isagi‚Äôs abs, and I don‚Äôt really blame him but it‚Äôs detracting from the magical evolution arc

Chigiri and Kunigami

+ Nothing

- These two are such NPCs together, like where‚Äôs the flavour? Awful ship 

Ness and Kaiser

+ Love how doting Kaiser is with Ness, really adds a 3rd dimension to his character aside from the German shenanigans. 

- Think Kaiser and Christopher would be a better fit, would put Ness with Richard too, because I just feel like it‚Äôs a bit forced and Ness doesn‚Äôt really see Kaiser‚Äôs value, it would do Ness some good to have more angst in his character.",Ash_Sparrow,1686761246.0

microsoft,"It not really possible to invest that kind of money in new IPs.

Like Apple cant just invest a trillion dollars to build out a cloud.

Now Microsoft likely vastly overpaid based on todays reduced market prices.

Usually if you buy a company and dont fuck it up,  its value stays consistent.

Spend 70 billion get IPs,  and its still worth 70 billion dollars... and maybe if you integrate it into what you do best its worth 200 billion.

Like a constructor worker buying a house - you buy a house for 300k,  there are some up front costs but it should still be worth 300k.  But your talents at construction can make that house worth 500k.

Thats what the goal of these mergers is... buying a company ""should"" maintain its value and your integration should grow its value.   This deal should immediately add 70 billion dollars to microsofts market cap... even though they are spending 70 billions.

But if you spent 70 billion dollars on building out a studios,  building out IP,  this is unknown cost - its spend,  its growth spend which doesnt necessary get reflected.   It might pay off better but its riskier and doesnt have immediate returns.  It might not get returns for a decade.

Buy stops are resting because some are waiting on price to break the supply zone and continue up and stop losses are there obviously because there are equal highs behind the supply zone(liquidity) so if (Goldman Sachs) can pump 10 billion into EURUSD to shoot it up, take out the stop losses & activate buy stops they now can trade freely without resistance once they pump the market back down now, because buyers (retail traders) are not there anymore which fuels the move down with no resistance.",NewspaperFamous7195,1686761740.0

Remember that it kind of depends on what you're trying to do with it--if you're writing a short story, seven realms might be a lot to try to fit in there, but you could still just hint at the differences without a ton of detail. If you're writing something more expansive, like a novel or a series or a setting for an RPG, you'll probably have plenty of time to add in stuff from different places over time. I'd just say don't feel like you have to include everything all at once, right at the start. Make there be a ""learning curve"" that gradually introduces a few concepts or places and then gets more complex with time, allowing readers to adapt to the new world.

Kiwami doesn't really have much appealing side content, I would only recommend trying to do Majima Everywhere and getting the Komaki moves.

For Kiwami 2 there is also the cabaret minigame and fun substories.

3 doesn't really have much interesting side content, I kinda rushed it, even. Maybe try doing some substories.

4 goes pretty much the same. Substories and karaoke.

5 has A LOT of side content tho. Try doing a few quests from the Haruka minigame and few substories at least, because it is the game with the most content in the series.

6 has some fun side minigames (like the spearfishing one) and it's substories are very good (for me it's probably the game with the best ones).

7 has the Ichiban Holdings minigame which was (at least for me) quite fun and the substories are also very good.

Judgment doesn't really have much side content, a few side cases are fun and all but it doesn't have really that much to it.

Now Lost Judgment's side content is amazing. Try doing a few of the schools activities, they are *really* fun. 

&#x200B;

Barcelona,"where is your airbnb? i'd definitely suggest taking the train to sants or passeig de gracia and finding your way from there. train accepts ""normal"" T-10 cards (that just have 10 passes in them). 

&#x200B;

metro doesn'T accept the normal cards, but it does accept T-usual (the unlimited monthly card for 20 euros). to get to the city centre it's slightly less convenient than the train but not too bad, and the stations are very new, clean and airconditioned. 

&#x200B;

train takes 27 minutes to the centre (passeig de gracia station) but it only runs every 20 minutes. has lifts and escalators in all stations, which makes it easier to move bags. when i took the metro the last time i travelled it did take me more or less 45 minutes to get home (in el raval, very close) with the metro. aerobus takes 30ish minutes to pla√ßa catalunya. there are also normal buses that go to pla√ßa espanya.

Pathfinder2e,">This is the only way I've heard this done in a way I like. Because it means the villain gets another go at critical story moments and doesn't go ""oops he showed his face and got suddenly crit down to death"".  
The fact it also can't be used directly in response to a hero point is also fantastic.  
I might adopt an edited version of that system, actually. Something like a ""Dramatic moment"" resource I get as a GM which, 3 times an arc, lets me basically give the villain a roll with +1 level of success on anything with the caveats that it:  
Can't be used in response to a player's Hero Point  
Can't be used multiple times in a single encounter  
Can only be used by named / important NPCs  
Must be used in a manner that creates for a more interesting narrative experience

Those are essentially the four unspoken rules put into place for our DM as well, though multiple times an encounter we're fine with, especially since it lets him use any unspent ones throughout the arc if things were going smoothly until the end, and if he wants to use them early, well now the boss IS open to the potential ""Foolish morta-"" \*crit chain, BBEG for the arc falls dead\* moments (which has led to a few funny moments at our group)",Willie5252,1686764130.0

The earliest manuscript, P115, depicting the verse in revelation was found to display the beast's number as 616, not 666. This was revealed in 2005.  
  
There are also many other verses that were probably not originally in the bible. It's called textual criticism.  
  
Now, do these differences make any doctrinal difference? No. And so they do not affect my faith at all. But to say the bible we have today is exactly the same as the original, I would disagree because it certainly hasn't matched the papyrus closest to the original manuscripts in the past in some instances.

I'm honestly not aware of any, aside from the fact that politicians can shrink our per capita debt while continuing to run deficits, and increase the money supply without triggering hyperinflation. Given the choice, do you think Canadians want more traffic, longer lines, bigger crowds, lower wages and less opportunity, more expensive and smaller housing, more crowded classrooms, more competition for post-secondary spots, less nature and biodiversity, and all the things we're seeing at our current rate of growth?

Planning for growth would be helpful, but at the end of the day it has to stop at some point - we can't just keeping adding people to a finite world and pretending that sustainable limits don't exist somewhere just because we've been able to innovate our way out of a population crisis with a mix of biotech and unsustainable farming techniques that are depleting the soil and pumping nitrates into our water, creating oceanic deadzones.",hobbitlover,1686761547.0

Have you come across 80000hours.org? If you are taking time to consider ‚Äòwhat next?‚Äô, then I wonder if you might find this helpful? It‚Äôs set up to support people to think about how to use their skills/experience to build a purposeful career. They even offer 1:1 sessions for anyone who‚Äôs interested in exploring what‚Äôs out there.

U could balance almost anything , If u keep iterating on it ... But a question of is this good gameplay should be asked .


To this very day ppl still complain about balance in every single rts ...  The fact is, asymmetrical design cannot ever be considered truely balanced... But we wouldn't have it any other way because nobody wants to play the same units vs the same units.

The prime deities undeniably exist in this word as a pantheon. They have been *exclusively* shown to be nothing but between neutral to good. Vasselheim and religious followers have been shown to be occasionally stuck up and intense at worst. So a hard turn out of nowhere doesn‚Äôt entirely make sense. 

And to the counterpoint, the village elder has also exaggerated to outright lied about the oppression from Vasselheim. She‚Äôs said the religion has forced conversion while we definitely know that‚Äôs not true. She‚Äôs implied the disappearances were caused by the religion when we also know that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm also somewhat surprised nobody in the party insight checked her ‚Äútithes we recovered were forced from the people so Im going to give them out.‚Äù Because that‚Äôs not how tithes work and a populist leader using some bread and circuses to shore up support is also a possibility.

I honestly fail to understand how where I shop for groceries or clothing can help improve their content. 

Obviously, they can run their company however they damn well please and make whatever content they want, but they've always seemed to be open to constructive feedback from fans and they've previously made adjustments to their content based on that feedback.

If your sub goes dark theres nothing stopping you or anyone from just making a new sub and posting over there.

Thats why you need to make the platform unusable and undesirable. People can find other subs. There's proof in this very post.

People are less likely to post and have fun in a hellscape and advertisers dont want their ads near that shit either (look at twitter!). That is what's going to tank ad revenue. If the crux of the protest is that the API change will make moderation suck then **SHOW THEM** how it will suck.

Show them how these 3rd party tools give reddit value. So they can gain an appreciation for the services they provide. Just blacking out does not communicate why yall are protesting the change.

gamedesign,"thats whats going on here. aside from the ""the game is supposed to be janky, getting used to the controls is a part of every game"" comment everything the dev has replied to has been like, describing to me how attack arcs work & telling me i'm supposed to put the mouse past the enemy, & it's like. no, you're not understanding. the character SPINS when i hit ctrl to face THE WRONG DIRECTION. im including videos & pics like in the OP to specifically demonstrate that the character turns away from the enemy when you go to initiate combat and he just, does not see what im talking about

but bc its on their personal forum instead of a DM, it's also got 2 forum-goers butting in to insist that its good actually that the game works like that, & then the dev going ""see you're being told by the community that they like it"" and im really getting the impression that the devs have very little interaction with people who haven't put 30,000 hours into their game

which is funny bc i literally bought the game so i can play it with my spouse & our friends, but my spouse looked at the Intended Features once, instantly got what the deal was without me mentioning any of this to her & went ""yeah im not gonna touch that"" so im refunding like 9 copies of the game bc i cant even tell them it'll get improved eventually

russian,">don't ask me whether a virus or a robot or a ghost are classed as animate or inanimate though, who the fuck knows

A virus is inanimate, a robot is animate, and with a ghost it depends on a specific synonym used, *obviously!*

Seriously though, wow. Quite a read clearly coming from personal struggle. I've known Russian was hard and I've seen many learners' specific issues here, but seeing it laid out in stages like this is quite enlightening.

The only part I have issue with is *""oh wait, no, it isn't, because ""dad"", ""man"" and ""grandpa"" are inexplicably declined like feminine words""*. Or rather, my issue is not with your take but with grammar books for language learners that for some reason (simplicity's sake I guess) invented a ""feminine declension"". The way grammar is explained to natives, declensions are grouped by an ending, and all nouns ending on -–∞ -—è form the ""first declension"". Of course we know that this group consists mostly of feminine nouns with some masculine sprinkled in, but it doesn't really matter - the pattern is consistent. So at least this part isn't ""unexplicable"", it's quite straightforward: –º—É–∂—á–∏–Ω–∞ ends on a, hence its declension pattern - case closed. Hopefully this will help you.",Sithoid,1686766700.0

nus,"I get what you are saying, except that the potential for NUS grads to make it into top firms is much less compared to Oxford grads. I am glad you mentioned HFT, because I have seen some HFTs even list NUS as 'others' in the education section in an application form, while I have never seen Oxford treated that way.

Another example is Citadel | Citsec - It is a top hedgefund | HFT right? They hired only 2 interns last summer from NUS (and 1 other from NTU), and only 3 interns in the summer before that (not sure if they hired 1 or 0 from NTU). In contrast, they hired like 25 students from Oxbridge last summer out of about 40 interns in total in their London office.

I do think Oxford may not be *that* nice when it comes to swe jobs, but still better than NUS. Plus for swe jobs, Sg is usually the office people care less about (Indeed for example).

But anyway, yes, I do think for swe jobs even just a mediocre US uni would be better, but that's not listed as an option in this post. Semi decent students in a mediocre US school could get into FAANG while semi decent students in NUS could what, go to Tiktok and Bytedance?

I mean, my whole point is that, yes it is possible NUS graduates can do ABC and get into top firm XYZ, but it is more likely those candidates could have shined anywhere anyway, while many other candidates from NUS, just as capable, do not stand such a chance because they get fewer opportunities as NUS graduates as opposed to being a grad from a better school, or a school with geographical advantage. My argument is rooted in the potentiality. If there is an option that increases successful likelihood ten-fold, I would take it every time.",pfzhao,1686756626.0

OnlyFansReviews,"Your request post has joined the moderating queue and will be evaluated for manual approval by mods. If your post does not get approved within the next 24 hours it is because it has not followed the request post guideline. You can read the guideline below, if you feel your post does not follow our guideline please delete it and repost. 

Request posts are for finding a specific ONLYFANS page and creator to SUBSCRIBE to. You can use request posts to find an onlyfans page that that offers specific content and aesthetics, genres and themes you are looking for.  

For example:  
*'I am looking for a busty  creator over 35 y/o who creates 'hot wife' content.'*  
*'I am looking for a creator with a nerdy aesthetic who uses bad dragon toys.'*  

The body of posts should go into more detail. You can include things such as budget, what kind of video content you would like available on their page or tip-able services and deal breakers.  

Requests are NOT for recruiting any nsfw creator/ seller to give you GFE, video call, sexting, someone nice to be your friend, someone to make a custom for you. This negates the point of making a request when you consider that nearly every onlyfans creator offers these services as tip-able extras on their page. Your request should primarily reference the on the feed content a creator is making or a creator with a specific look and style.  

Things you absolutely cannot request:

I know to *us* Mann seems young, but he's gonna be 27 years old this year lol.  If they're doing a full rebuild, he's pretty pointless to have.  Bones is probably the better, more reasonable target for them to have because he can actually start there.

End of the day, even if they want young players + picks... they're almost certainly not going to get that.  There are very, very few teams that will be in the market for Beal and none of them are looking to really gut their roster for him.

Griffith and his complete army attacks on the East (the Kushan Empire), while Guts and co. go for saving Casca. When Griffith absolutely destroys the Kushan's area, Rickert Rakshasa Silad and his co. will be somehow saved by Zodd (because Zodd in my theory is Kushan member himself - he occasionally wears Kushan's armor set + he was left thoughtless/speechless of Griffith's decision to attack the East (it was indeed, the first time ever that Zodd didn't immediately agreed (and still hasn't) to his Lord). So, Rickert and his machines and co. absolutely destroys a lot of weaker apostles and possibly defeats one of the strongest, Locus/Irvine/Grunbeld, then they're saved by Zodd who escapes from Griffith and flies off directly to Falconia to tell Casca to join him in fighting Femto, as just then, he sees Guts and co. with Casca (Guts and others easily met Casca since there's not so much army left in Falconia), then Zodd proceeds to teamup with Guts, and when Griffith destroys and conquers rhe Kushan area, he reclaims it as his own, now he comes back to Falconia to face off against Zodd. Just then, Guts and everyone on his side, fights with Femto, as Zodd pushes back Locus, Grunbeld and Irvine (if they're alive) by himself (he's truly the strongest apostl–µ, cuz he only knows to fight and kill, fight and kill, so his battle iq and history of battles/experience are heavily on his side), he maybe manages to kill all of those 3, as Guts struggles (again, against Femto) then Femto with a single blow (matter manipulation/wraption) nearly kills Guts but he's saved by the Beast of Darkness, then Guts in total despair, his Behelit activates on his own, as suddenly the Astral Lords fall upon him, the 4 Godhand members are trying to manipulate Guts to sacrifice something to become more powerful, as he rejects then Femto (as egoistic as he is), doesn't care about Guts since for him Guts is already nearly dead, and because Femto is always ambitious and has to go higher and higher, attacks the Godhands, in the process kills in marvelous fight Slan, Ubik and Conrad, and then SK joins the whole event, as he Zodd and co. + Flora can summon the 5 Gods of element and attack simultaneously Void, so he would die. Then the only one left is Femto, as Moonlight Boy somehow dies (either is killed by Guts in Berserker armor or has somewhat even more tragedic death) which would cause Femto to die, then eventually all apostles with him, as there's no more point in Idea of Evil to be around anymore, then Guts lives with Casca probably on Elfhelm along with his friends (if they survive), as Skull Knight either lives with Flora or vanishes forever (most likely, because his final goal of defeating Void is completed)",Soggy-Calligrapher10,1686769911.0

Aliexpress,"I would absolutely love an option to opt out of any combined deliveries. If there are any issues with the shipping or orders it will be a mess with customer service if you get any at all. Dispute request just keeps telling me to wait another 11 days for an answer stating they need more info. Pretty sure they are just trying to run the clock until buyer protection runs out so that nothing can be done. Every time I contact their chat service the rep says that they have escalated the request and I should have it resolved within 48 hours. A week later they are still telling me the same thing. Flat out lies and I have received zero confirmation via email that anything they are saying is legitimate.   


My most recent order that was automatically combined did actually come within a reasonable amount of time, but unfortunately I am out of town to be able to check that everything actually arrived ok. I know for certain that I will be recording the unboxing of the packing via video  to make sure I have sufficient evidence that everything is correct though.

retailhell,"Every time I try to use a $100 bill anywhere, before I even pull it out of my wallet, I'm asking the cashier ""can you make change for 100?""

If they are even a bit hesitant, I'll use smaller bills.  And then I'll ask the cashier at the next place I buy things at.

So I could try breaking at a fast food joint, then the movie theater, and then the convenience store on my way home.  I might still have the $100 afterwards.

But it's about saying ""Hey, I know it might be inconvenient, but if you have a full till, can I get change?"" without being verbose.  Just ""can you do it?""

And what weirds me out is that there are people who legit want to start having bills LARGER than 100s, due to inflation.  And it's true, pennies are worthless, and even nickels and dimes are kinda silly at this point for most purchases.  But can you imagine having a customer ask you to break a 500?

Hell, then there's also the crime risk.  If ""can you break 500"" is a normal question, and you say 'yes', then you've told the guy asking (who could be looking for a store to rob) that you have at least $500 in the till.",Educational_Ebb7175,1686770207.0

PartneredYoutube,"Nothing you can do but wait and see what comes of your partner application. I suppose it's possible something about your channel triggered a deeper YT review either because you applied for partnership or at around the same time, and that could explain the no ads right now. Obviously, channels that apply for partnership get a review. 
And it could just mean you're waiting on a real person to review the channel and give it the ""all good"" sign. Or the opposite could be happening.
You said 'family' channel... Does that mean it shows/features kids? Made for kids?

I think more likely you're just seeing the ebb and flow of YT. People get on the coaster ride going up and think ""We made it!""... thinking that is the new normal. Then the ride stops and goes back down. Usually back to a point just a smidge higher than where it was when it had the ride to the peak. So the new normal is usually higher than before the peak, but not much higher and definitely the peak wasn't the new normal.

Then... weeks... months... will pass and it will repeat this process. In most cases, it's not even easy to understand why a video or series of videos ascended again. You can repeat everything you can think to repeat an recreate or sustain it.. all to no avail.. and then one day... it happens again. Rinse and repeat.",bball2014,1686770937.0

I was wondering what models have you found after your research and which if one were to ask, you might suggest.  And specifically  for the most part built  for capacity   around specifically drawing and art and also using the two screens with the latter more priority so to speak.  Also do you know what kind of drawing aspects for the stylus that many might not know  about that you found  out could benefit the artist. Sorry for the lengthy question  .

Pofear, pohate bar CT,  all kael bar vindi/AoW, all tov and minis bar the name dragons, gore, faydedar, trakanon, VS, will always be a knight tank. So you will tank at end game.
As to FSI.... the times I have died to a bash interrupt are very minimal. Maybe 2 or 3 times ever.
I have max str and max sta in my gear and buffs, so there no advantage for stats either once you're in raid gear.
The BE clickies helped in leveling, but other than cos and J boots (which all races can use), I don't use any at 60. And they weren't make or break during leveling. Just nice to have.
I way prefer looking at a dark elf in purple plate than an ogre.
So yes.... Ogre is best if you are min maxing, but I can tank anything an ogre can, and I can FD without dying due to interrupt 99% of the time.

Testosterone,"Hmm. Well, as others have said, it could merely be your E2 being a bit low. At 15, I'm OK, but libido is much better at 18-25 ish. Could even be 27. 

But otherwise, yes, something changed here, and it seems to happen more often than not, and mysteriously, with testosterone cypionate. I'm not convinced it's best for EVERYONE. I mean: I long half life ester = somewhat continuous testosterone release from the depot and into systemic circulation, but that isn't necessarily GREAT for everyone, and doesn't in any way match your diurnal rhythm. So who knows: maybe it's crashing your SHBG, and you can't adequately transport test and DHT around to tissues. 

At the same time, shorter esters like propionate reportedly give people far better libido and erections, which would make sense, considering its extremely short half life, and more mimicry of natural test. 

Then there's creams/gels, which despite the general tone here, DO WORK wonders for guys. I mean: cream on scrotum => 5-alpha reducing into high levels of DHT => libido. Scrotum has a ton of 5ARs, which is why that application can increase libido/eq. 

So it's complicated. I DESPISE this notion that ""well - your levels look fine, must be something else."" Cypionate is HIGHLY anabolic, and far LESS androgenic than say.. propionate, which is highly androgenic, and not as anabolic. Etc etc etc.",R_Michael_Ballow,1686772849.0

ffmpeg,"* I don't think trim filter parses HH:MM:SS format correctly, it should be a duration value, example 00:06:49 equals 409 seconds 
* The output is 13 seconds due to the parsing issue:  
`[AVFilterGraph @ 0x560e20270980] Setting 'start' to value '00'`  
`[AVFilterGraph @ 0x560e20270980] Setting 'end' to value '06'`  
`[AVFilterGraph @ 0x560e20270980] Setting 'start_pts' to value '49'`  
`[AVFilterGraph @ 0x560e20270980] Setting 'end' to value '00'`  
`[AVFilterGraph @ 0x560e20270980] Setting 'start' to value '07'`  
`[AVFilterGraph @ 0x560e20270980] Setting 'end' to value '13'`  
This shows wrong start and end times, you can see it by adding -loglevel debug to your command  

* Actually trim filter will remove everything and keep only the video included in your time between 6:49 and 7:13  
The translation of your command would be: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex ""[0:v]trim=start=409:end=433,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v]; [0:a]atrim=start=409:end=433,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a]"" -map [v] -map [a] output1.mp4`  

* If you want to remove this part the command should be: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex ""[0:v]trim=end=409,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v0];[0:a]atrim=end=409,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a0];[0:v]trim=start=433,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v1];[0:a]atrim=end=433,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a1];[v0][a0][v1][a1]concat=n=2:v=1:a=1[vtrim_out][atrim_out]"" -map [vtrim_out] -map [atrim_out] -y output1.mp4`  
This keeps the part from the beginning till 409 (00:06:49), and the part from 433 (00:07:13) till the end of the video and then use the filter concat to combine the kept parts  


The Faster way is to use -ss -to and concat muxer:  
`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -to 00:06:49 -c copy out1.ts`  
`ffmpeg -ss 00:07:13 -i input.mp4 -c copy out2.ts`  
`ffmpeg -i ""concat:out1.ts|out2.ts"" -c copy output3.mp4`

note the .ts format in the intermediate files, this will copy the parts without re-encoding",Marware,1686772543.0

UniUK,"Few questions, but will your resits in July be capped at 40%? If they are, what grade will you achieve? And also what subject do you do?

Secondly, life is pretty hard after uni if you haven't been doing internships in the summer and haven't been lining up a job for when you graduate. The ones from well-to-do families know this, and those people have jobs lined up right out of uni.

When I left uni, I had nothing lined up as I got lost in the sauce and partied way too hard. The thing I was most interested in (econometrics and statistics) I didn't put enough effort in and scraped a pass in.

I still managed to get a 2:1 overall, but it took me a while after uni to figure out properly what I wanted to do. I had a blast at uni and met a lot of friends and had a crazy crazy time partying so I guess in comparison to some people who look back on uni who missed out on that, I miss not having tried as hard as I should have, and I should have thought about things sooner rather than later.

You have time though, one option depending on your subject to do a master's but I would only recommend it if having more specialized knowledge in that subject opens your chances more for job opportunities. For example, if you did economics, specializing in something like econometrics and data science would be beneficial, provided you go balls to the walls with it, as these technical skills are sought after.

To add, traditional university courses tend to be focused a lot on skills that are important in a research setting, but not really too much on skills that an employer would value, which is fine, both have their advantages and disadvantages. I would, however, take this summer to really have a long think about what skills you have and where you think these skills could fit and aid your potential employer, and maybe even upskill if you can potentially. The skills pay the bills, literally.

asexuality,"when predators are in a church, the right ignores it and the left says ""religion is bad."" when predators are in LGBTQ settings, the left ignores it and the right says ""gay/trans is bad."" the word groomer is used to label non-cishets for the same reason that some non-religious people generalize Christians as preying on children.

historically a lot of predators have been in public schools because they have more access to kids. recently there has been another trend, that some have taken advantage of the lgbtq community, using that as a shield, in the same way they hide behind schools and churches.

I'm comparing this to the church or a school to try to illustrate something. I'm a Christian and I am lgbtq, and I don't associate either group with ""being groomers"". I just believe that we should do everything we can to protect kids. A lot of things are covered up by schools, churches, and so on, and I'm starting to see that happen with lgbtq groups as well which is very worrying to me as a queer person.

that's one of the problems I've noticed. I can join a child advocacy group like you said, but these are some emerging issues within the queer community l and so far there isnt a lot being done. maybe I can create my own thing about it, who knows.",REAL_MORTALIS,1686773127.0

PartneredYoutube,"Nothing you can do but wait and see what comes of your partner application. I suppose it's possible something about your channel triggered a deeper YT review either because you applied for partnership or at around the same time, and that could explain the no ads right now. Obviously, channels that apply for partnership get a review. 
And it could just mean you're waiting on a real person to review the channel and give it the ""all good"" sign. Or the opposite could be happening.
You said 'family' channel... Does that mean it shows/features kids? Made for kids?

I think more likely you're just seeing the ebb and flow of YT. People get on the coaster ride going up and think ""We made it!""... thinking that is the new normal. Then the ride stops and goes back down. Usually back to a point just a smidge higher than where it was when it had the ride to the peak. So the new normal is usually higher than before the peak, but not much higher and definitely the peak wasn't the new normal.

Then... weeks... months... will pass and it will repeat this process. In most cases, it's not even easy to understand why a video or series of videos ascended again. You can repeat everything you can think to repeat an recreate or sustain it.. all to no avail.. and then one day... it happens again. Rinse and repeat.",bball2014,1686770937.0

badroommates,"Both roommates are clearly irresponsible - the 63-year old shouldnt have pets if she cant properly take care of them. Not to mention, she needs to clean up after them, they're not your responsibility at all. The other one is just leeching off of you guys, start locking your doors and your stuff.

Your girlfriend, while going through what she's going through, also needs to take responsibility for her mental health and prioritize herself, get her into additional therapy if she needs it and try to keep her interactions minimal with her ex-bff. 

Finally, recognize you're the sane adult in this situation and take responsibility for yourself - make sure you and your GF are safe and minimize contact with the other roommates unless you think the situation can be saved (at this point, it's unlikely, but you can try to have a roommate meeting to go over everyone's concerns and try to find a solution that works best for everyone) They may be more amicable but you gotta leave emotion out of it and come at it from a more practical side (please clean up after your dog, you should probably have a more stable income, etc.) 

Honestly, your best bet is to stick it out till the lease ends if you can't move out right now and see what other offers are available in your area. Do ""roommate dating"" and see what you can get and look at listings, it'll help get you and GF through the next few months. 

Lastly, try to give your GF her own space, even if it's a small one, to put her stuff and to organize. Even a small plant on a shelf works, or getting her a little cubby where she can have snacks or crafts available. Right now, she probably feels like she's spiraling and having something stable in her view will help her adjust to normalcy faster.

serialkillers,"Excerpt from a historical document about the Pite»ôti Phenomenon ‚Äî Reeducation through torture in the Romanian Communist State:

""The uninterrupted torture and its consequences.

 After the initial shock, the victim becomes incapable of reacting in a certain way. Everything seems hopeless. The victim is convinced that things are organized this way. There is no way out... The torture continues day and night without interruption. It is torture for the sake of torture.

It should be noted that in this infernal laboratory, only ≈¢urcanu had excellent physical condition. Then his assistants were slightly better fed than the average prisoners. Otherwise, the young people appeared as walking skeletons, living corpses, true mummies.

From this borderline phase of death, the uninterrupted torture begins.

Within the context of torture, the victims were subjected to immense efforts meant to completely exhaust them physically. Here's how:

The victims, loaded with weights on their backs (blankets or thicker clothes), were forced to perform squats with their hands raised upwards, in a regulated manner.

Some of the victims collapsed at 30-40 squats, but there were others who resisted up to 2,500 squats. Unbelievable!

There is no athlete in the world, even with the best physical condition, who could achieve such a performance. And yet, it is achieved by a skeleton melted by hunger and suffering! The human body, in conditions of despair escaping the control of reason, managed, in Pite»ôti, to achieve the unimaginable, the impossible.

Neurologists, psychiatrists, and even theologians have the duty to study and explain this phenomenon!

The torture does not stop here; it continues...

Physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion as well. The victim doesn't have a single moment of respite for recovery. Reason is shaken, willpower darkens. All emotional states disappear from the person's mind. Affection disappears... The person begins to lose rationality.

The young person has the impression that their entire nervous system is a fresh and bleeding wound. A pathological state is established. Then the phenomenon occurs where all the secrets that they kept well hidden in their consciousness overflow. From this phase on, even the smallest secret that the young person has is felt like a thorn in their eye. They cannot bear it, and they do everything possible to eliminate it.

In this phase, the entire reason enters a shadowy portion. All the reflexes acquired throughout life are nullified. A total darkness sets in the human brain. It is no longer what it was. It has become nothing. The person has become an absolute robot without any personality, without imagination, without initiative. The last support that the person loses is faith in God. This is the moment when ""brainwashing"" is completed.

From now on, the victims are no longer in control of their own reflexes. They find themselves in a state similar to a trained animal. If they are commanded to lie down, they lie down with astonishing speed. If they are ordered to shout, they shout with all their might. If they are asked to grab a club and strike their comrade next to them, they do it automatically. Like a robot. The victim - or rather the ""reeducated"" individual - looking at their own hand, is amazed at how it functions. They have the impression that it is not their own.""",JasonSkolimski,1686765637.0

slaythespire,"As much as I wouldn‚Äôt want to I‚Äôd prob still take sozu here.  Very begrudgingly.

Your deck really really benefits from that extra energy with all of the 2 cost cards you have.

Missing out on potions is going to hurt especially in the long run, but I don‚Äôt think the deck stands much of a chance without the extra energy of getting out of act 2 anyways, so I think hedging your bets on more energy is better in the short term and try and shore your deck up in the mean time.

Act 2 elites are going to be very rough as your deck stands, without the extra energy you can almost guarantee that you lose to most of them or at least take way more damage.

Black star - can‚Äôt justify taking it, your deck isn‚Äôt primed for hunting elites I doubt you would be able to squeeze value out of it. 

Tiny house - Better than nothing, you can take it here and it would be a route to go.  Though you are placing your success of future drafts/good shops to help fill gaps while your deck gets its bearing.

datascience,"First I would just caution the confirmation bias that most DSs are spending all their spare time contributing to open-source work, doing grounbreaking stuff w/ LLMs, etc. There are plenty who do so, but they are also going to be the loudest. No one is on LinkedIn bragging about how they work 40 hours and then see their families on evenings and weekends with a healthy work-life balance.

However, I do think DS is one of the fastest evolving careers. I specialized in NLP, got my Master's in 2019, and now what I learned in school is already two generations outdated. I think that if you got into the field because you love math and also like money (I'm in the same camp), then I think you should consider a management track. If you find that sort of things valuable, I think you could severely reduce the amount of self-study you need to do, and you should be plenty equipped to manage some of the ICs who are more in-the-weeds of the latest trends.

Personally, I don't see myself being a DS IC for the next 30 years, it does feel like a young man's game and reading papers, learning the newest frameworks, and chasing metrics feels tiring. I see myself in 10 years instead leading a team of people with a little more passion for that, but I'd still like to be involved in the space of using math to solve business problems.",dajar88,1686774852.0

I had loved Super Mario Galaxy so much that as a child I was very excited about playing as the child of my new hero, so I packed almost all of my hours on the game as Baby Mario (until I discovered Dry Bowser and he's never left me ever since lol).

Homebrewing,"I read a similar thread from the developer.  He even showed a graph where the redacted the App names, but showed that App #1 had used a giant proportion more API calls than the next biggest offender.  I dont agree with the way the CEO is taking this (very much an US vs Them scenario, it should be a WE scenario), but I also believe the developer can refine his app into something that fits the API model better.  Reddit makes some money, Apollo makes some money and the users are relatively happy.

The crux just sounds like the time/effort to develop a more efficient app wont be quick or easy.  In my opinion, Reddit should provide a bigger grace period, and Apollo should try to meet half way.

- 35-44 HRs
- above average framing
- average to above average blocker with difficulty blocking balls breaking below the zone 
- above average pop time with transfer issues
- cannon of an arm but accuracy issues

So far he‚Äôs been exactly that, just 3-6 months before predicted. (Obviously bear writers looking for headlines and such had other takes, but IMO only teams scouts who are watching the player ever day really matter). 

In theory the Mets Scouts are professionals who dedicate their careers to this, and the Mets have typically been viewed as having a top tier scouting department. So I‚Äôm going by what they projected as his most likely future over speculating a best case scenario. 

Could be some day raise his ceiling to hit .270? Sure. Could Alonso in theory have a .300+ AVG season someday? Sure.

Funny enough, we were told he was a dachshund/beagle/Australian cattle dog mix, but had an Embark DNA test done (HIGHLY recommend btw!) and turns out he is quite the mutt:  mostly dachshund of course, but also chihuahua, rat terrier, little Australian cattle dog (definitely see ACD in his coat, it‚Äôs pretty unique), and *zero* beagle! One hell of an attractive dog in any case!

PartneredYoutube,"Nothing you're saying contradicts my statements. Of course it's a risky career move to 'be a youtuber'. But that doesn't mean you haven't 'made it' when making $4k/month (and by your own account turning down offers for more money). 'Making it' doesn't entail 'keeping it'.

Nor am I saying that someone your age should simply go full tilt into YouTubing with little care about other transferable (and long term less risky) skills and qualifications.

But $4k a month is significantly higher than the median income of the US - it's even close to the median household income. For someone in their late 20s, it's even more significantly ahead of the curve.

You were (are?) in an amazing financial position (please say you've saved some of that money) - but at the same time, I totally understand that it's not all sunshine and rainbows, and that there are anxieties and problems that came along with that life.

Coco math tells me there aren't enough creatures in the deck, 22 means you get an EV of 1.68 creatures per coco which isn't very good.

Other times, there a few variant of the same board layout but with different ICs that supports different functionality.. so just having the pads there, doesn't automatically means that the functionality is supported by the ICs, firmware or whatever.

the original commenter wanted to reach 1600 for akkan but honed his 5(!) alts to 1560. the mats they spend doing that could have got them a long way to reaching their goal. you're joining into that conversation and go ""nuh-uh you actually have to spend more on honing one char to 1600 then to hone 5 alts to 1560 and you actually can't reach 1600 just with bound mats"". yes, we know. that was never the argument. the argument was that them reaching 1600 until akkan could have been possible had they allocated their ressources differently. so i'm really not sure what you're trying to achieve here.",Ebbe_Sand,1686777835.0

People have mentioned hemorrhoids as a possibility, which is a more common cause and can typically be treated over the counter. There are also more uncommon causes like celiacs, which I have and have experienced bleeding from. I would start looking into some of the more common causes perhaps and hemorrhoids can be external and may be easier to identify than something else.",WhenItRains23,1686777074.0

singaporefi,"Here are the cards I use - context: monthly spend of 1-2k per month, with occasional big ticket purchases:

1. HSBC Revo: 2.5% cashback or 4mpd on a broad range of spending, capped at 1k/month. No annual fee. Public transport not entitled to bonus miles/cashback. I usually max this 1k/month out first.  

2. UOB Preferred Platinum Visa: 4mpd on a broad range of mobile contactless payments (e.g Apple pay), capped at 1.1k/month. I use this after I have hit the 1k cap on HSBC revo, because UOB PPV miles are computed by $5 blocks (rounded down), thus slightly worse than HSBC revo.  

3. OCBC titanium: 4mpd on shopping, departmental stores etc, capped at \~$13k per \*year\*. I use this for big ticket items, e.g furniture, TV, laptop, which will exceed the $1k/month cap for the two cards above.  

4. SCB Smart Card: 6% cashback for public transport, digital subscriptions, fast food. Quite limited range of places to spend, so I only use this for public transport. No annual fee.  

5. Amex True cashback: 1.5% unlimited cashback on a very broad range of spending. It even covers certain typical exclusions from other cards (e.g payments at hospitals). I use this for any medical spending (myself or family), or when I'm not sure whether a certain transaction will be covered by any of the above cards - basically a ""catch-all"" card.   


Since you mention travel, I think DBS Altitude Visa is a good choice which I will be getting soon. Also if you're into chasing miles, do also use the Kris+ app whenever you make payments at a Kris+ partner merchant - the miles are stackable with your credit card miles. Atome (BNPL) is also another good to have - by splitting your payments into 3 instalments, you can get around the 1k/month cap for HSBC Revo.

msp,"Two data points:

1. Server for a small business, 3 VMs on it, some database apps all of the users use all the time. ""Mixed Usage"" Server SSDs that HP recommends. Server is running for 3,5 years now. Remaining lifetime on the SSDs according to HP software: 99%. So yeah, they'll probably not die of to much writing anytime soon. And consumer SSDs probably wouldn't have died of this either.
2. Another server for small business (not brought in by us, we took over later). Running on Samsung customer SSDs in a RAID1 for a bit more than four years now. Also no problems.

So would I recommend customer grade SSDs? Not really. First of all because I have seen quite a few of them drop dead (in workstations, not servers), and I at least hope that the risk or that happening is a bit lower on server grade SSDs.

But more importantly: *if* such a drive drops dead and it's consumer grade, then I'm the idiot who used a non-recommended configuration and I'll take the blame. People will say: *""that wouldn't have happened with a server grade SSD!""* (which could be nonsense, but that doesn't matter in that situation.) If the same happens to a server grade SSD, then it's just ""shit happens"". Who can blame us if HP (or whoever) delivered crappy quality server SSDs?",b00nish,1686778588.0

leetcode,"**Two words:** chunking and incremental coding

**TL;DR**  
This reminds me of myself a couple of years back. Even when I had a functional solution and was confident in my understanding of the problem, there was always at least one silly issue that stopped my code from work the first time round.

Here‚Äôs what worked for me, chunking and incremental coding:

* prior to writing a single line of code, I break my code down into chunks and outline this with succinct comments
* If I‚Äôve done a good job of chunking, during implementation I just focus on each chunk, one by one. The reason this reduces errors, is each chunk is so small and simple that the likelihood of making a mistake is very low, especially because I don‚Äôt have to think about the rest of the algorithm.

This is very valuable during high-pressure, time-constrained interview conditions with some interviewer breathing down your neck I.e. conditions where it‚Äôs so easy to make mistakes

Join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/eNYYvpRyBt), community of folks optimising their interview performance. Just like some algorithms have better runtime complexity than other algorithms on the same hardware, so do some interview prep strategies. Hoping you can pick up something, and maybe share some of yours.

**More detail:**

There was always at least one silly bug, that would take a long time to uncover. To overcome this, I developed a strategy that now ensures my code operates as intended on the first run about 99% of the time.

Here is a streamlined version of my strategy:

1. Preliminary Thinking: I start by spending 5 to 15 minutes 'algorizing,' which essentially means identifying at least two feasible solutions. I mentally traverse these algorithms, evaluate their efficiency, and project their implementation time then pick the best one. Importantly, I test these potential solutions using carefully curated, minimal yet comprehensive test cases, which enable me to ascertain the correctness of my algorithms.
2. Skeleton Coding: I break the task into key segments and devise a structure using comments. For instance, while solving a problem involving heaps, my skeleton code might look like this:
3. Incremental Implementation: I then fill in the logic within each section of my skeleton code I.e. each chunk. When I am focusing on each chunk, it‚Äôs usually just a small coding task that I can just focus on and handle perfectly without thinking about the rest of the code of the whole algorithm. This way I‚Äôm less likely to make mistakes.
4. Passive Testing: Rather than immediately running my code, I write out test cases and mentally step through each line with the sample input to check the output.

Upon reaching this stage, I am assured that my code functions as expected, and I proceed to execute my test cases or submit the solution.

After practicing this multiple times it becomes second nature, and I never have to think about each step.

Happy to shed more light. I‚Äôve got a community of over 100 folks on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/eNYYvpRyBt). We discuss strategies to improve our coding and interviewing skills, so we can gain an edge. I think you‚Äôll benefit if you join especially if you‚Äôre looking for a job/internship within the next year

step1,"Passed! Mid-low tier medical school, I am trying to get into internal medicine programs but in competitive schools. I tried studying for the test as if it was graded and that mindset helped a lot. I also get majorrrr test anxiety for standardized tests so I wanted to overshoot my NBMEs by a lot so even if I had a horrible test day (which kinda felt like I did) I would hopefully still pass. Have been very grateful to the reddit community for helping me figure out what resources to use, literally came to reddit for advice always!

In class CBSE (7 weeksout): 52%

Form 25 (5 weeks out): 54%

Form 26 (4 weeks out): 64%

Form 27 (3 weeks out): 65%

Form 28 (2 weeks out): 62%, was officially freaking out and thinking of canceling my exam but I had also learned a lot of material that week and knew it needed time to sink in and did a lot of u world

Form 29 (9 days out): 84%, felt a LOT more confident now

Form 31 (4 days out): 78%

Free120 (3 days out): 75% and the last section I took with only 40 minutes because I accidentally took too long a break (helped to know how breaks work for the actual exam though)

UWorld: Finished 71%, score 58%

Test day: **Passed**. Was feeling a LOT of anxiety. Felt like the first 2 sections went very very poorly. Then our prometric center lost wifi and our test was pushed back an hour which did not help with anxiety. Came out feeling horrible, only remembering questions I got wrong and felt anxiety pretty much the whole 3 weeks while waiting for my results. I know a lot of that was test anxiety but basically was having nightmares that I failed the last few days. 

If I were to give myself advice now/advice for future test takers: 

* Pathoma 1-3 have it memorized word for word
* finish Uworld and include missed questions on Uworld near the end
* review EVERY NBME THOROUGHLY because I felt like some q came directly from those or were variations of NBME questions
* Pixorize for Biochem and Immuno (focus on path for those)
* Pharm memorize agonist vs ANTagonist thoroughly (on the day of the test when you're feeling anxious, you don't want to have to reason through it)
* Make a note sheet to review throughout the studying process (esp stuff you miss often) and use it as a quick review the days before your exam
* First aid rapid review a few days before your exam

&#x200B;

Studying tips that worked for me:

* Filtered decks on Anki and  Anking are your BEST FRIENDS, start Anking during school and keep up with as much of it as you can
   * I used filtered decks to review subject wise sometimes, it reduced my mental load when my reviews were higher. Sometimes I used them to review cards in the order of videos. I would rewatch videos of things I missed and filter them out of my main anking deck to review
   * I also kept up with only Cardio, Neuro, Endocrine, and GI Anking but those were major subjects so that helped in dedicated! I still had to review them though
* Flagging Highest Yield cards and Higher Yield cards on Anking as two different flag colors, and then ONLY unlocking those in my first pass
   * this was hella helpful to reduce the card burden
* NOTE: IMO Anking is not a deck you try to finish per say, it is meant for easy resource guiding so if your goal is to finish sketchy and B&B and pixorize, it is okay if you don't unlock EVERY anking card!! That is how I took it anyway
* UWORLD ANKI ADD ON ([https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/444814983](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/444814983)), what a life saver!! Allowed me to review anki cards related to uworld questions by adding in the qu codes, and I would only put missed or flagged q
* Keeping a master doc of screenshots from UWorld, NBMEs, first aid of material I kept missing that I could refer back to
* Boards and Beyond I found to be the most comprehensive resource

&#x200B;

For those who get test anxiety like me. Its okay to feel that way, but make sure you try and reframe the hard work you did. If you have a good therapist, definitely utilize them during dedicated! Make sure you get some sun, do not stay inside all day. If you can incorporate exercise, do it. If you can't, try to get up occasionally and stretch and thats good too. You are all extremely intelligent people and deserve to be here so don't allow this test to make you feel otherwise!!",Least_Agent_5415,1686778484.0

HelluvaBoss,"I personally did not like the Circus. To me it really flattened a lot of things in HB. Now Stolas and Blitzo are a childhood crush that is meant to be and Stolas is innocent because his wife is a total bitch with no redeeming qualities (who we now also know is a complete dumbass). Paimon is just a boring shithead much like most characters in the show (this show needs more variety in characters). Goetias have normal human ages (seriously what compelled Viv to make Stolas in his 30's?). And overall the entire story just became so much more safe and generic.

Not only did that episode killed any chance for interesting conflict and nuance in this story, but also really made it's setting all the more pointless. Why is this show set in Hell? This is one of my biggest questions at this point. Stolas is just a sad owl aristocrat in his 30s who has some magic and fell in love with a lower class citizen as a child. It just doesn't utilize it's setting in a meaningful way. 

The age thing kills potential for exploring interesting concepts like dealing with immortality. Different view of life someone like Stolas may have. Their mental struggles. Possible insanity over their age. Stolas being a DEMON and maybe that contributing into him having a very disturbing view of love or how he treats everyone. How Goetia's society function. A society of immortal Demons. It's all gone. Just like that. All because of this one stupid decision.

It's just a waste. A sad waste. Honestly you could replace setting of HB with some kind of furry sci-fi/fantasy planet and not much would change. You could do that before I would say, but with this change it became really solidified in my mind. Honestly even the job I.M.P. doesn't contribute much to anything at this point either. There is no point for this show to be set in Hell. And it's a shame because Hell is an interesting setting to create interesting societies in where cruelty and unthinkable torment are a norm. Where strange and often disturbing things may happen at random and beings living in it have cultures based around those things. 

There is so much one could do in terms of society, mindsets, religions, philosophies and just ways of life in this setting, but Viv just chose to make it shitty earth... and that would make sense for Pride, but it's entirety of it which is a shame. 

Damn... Went on a rant here. Sorry for that. I am just passionate about things like that and I am just depressed when I see potential getting squandered over and over again.",AzraelSoulHunter,1686779191.0

oklahoma,"So, I was actually looking into the differences between California and Oklahoma in terms of income, cost of living, and taxes because my tribe is in Shawnee and I was considering moving there from Orange County. And yeah, as a Californian making below $120k/yr, my cumulative tax burden (everything from sales tax to property tax and every form of tax) is lower in California than it would be Oklahoma. Now, if I was a millionaire and owned a business, then my taxes would be higher in California, but only by a few percent. Even though California is ungodly expensive, rent is just dumb, and it can get pretty congested in some areas, in relative terms California is actually more affordable than Oklahoma.",micktalian,1686780570.0

wrestling,"Record yourself, rewatch yourself to identify what you would like to improve. A broad term I use is position. Improving your position in top bottom or neutral helps you to minimize getting into a compromising position where your opponent can score. 

Be active not reactive. Your goal is to score points from any position. 

In neutral‚Ä¶ what are you looking to do? How can you set that up? What are your other moves branching from your go to when the opponent does x/y/z? Always wrestle to your outs. 

On bottom‚Ä¶ learn how to maintain and rebuild your base and get sealed to one side. If chopped, flare elbows to the mat and always palms up outside your elbow. Do you like to Create space (sit out, knee slide) or crowd your opponents hips (sit back, inside leg thru the back, pressure back to feet on mat) work on your best move on bottom and the best move you can do when thats countered. 
 
On top, learn to stop the first move, get off your knees, find the best breakdown you can do consistently and what your favorite pinning combinations are. Learn to get to cover their hips at all times until they are broken down. Do you like to ride with an inside chop, 1-1, tight waist, claw, thigh pry‚Ä¶ figure out your favorite and use it all the time. 

Always work to score points from wherever you are. Increase your conditioning so that you can perform while you are tired. Youd be surprised how many matches you can win when the other guy is tired.

If you can manage to not get taken down, turned or ridden out, you tend to win alot.",Zyupaka,1686778750.0
HighStrangeness,"Yeah, my moms house is like 140 years old, but they've gotten loads of things updated and have carbon monoxide detectors and whatnot.

Carbon monoxide didn't shove a porcupine quill into a photo of my grandpa, in his head. It didn't take two separate pieces of asparagus out of the fridge and align them as if they were whole in the bathtub. Carbon Monoxide didn't slam on the 2nd story floor, right above where I was walking on the 1st floor. It wasn't Carbon Monoxide when my friend and I were just chilling on my bed and my box fan started violently shaking back and forth, just to suddenly stop totally still as if it hadn't moved at all.

The only one who's had a 'hallucination' is me. I saw a black mass sink into the floor of my closet, after getting this alarming 'RUN' feeling as I went up the stairs to my room.  Same general area as the slam came from several years later. A friend admitted to seeing some strange shadows in the reflection of my monitor years after they happened, but the only person who's actually seen whatever it is, eyes on it, is me. I don't believe I was hallucinating, and the memory is still totally clear in my mind today, 14 years later.

Everything else is just things moved in ways that make no sense. She has like 4 carbon monoxide detectors, and if one of us had been tripping out and doing it, one of the other two people in the house would have seen. Some of these things appeared within moments of us being nearby, seeing everything normal. 

It may account for some, but definitely not all. Whatevers in my moms house would get aggressive if you called it Carbon Monoxide. You cannot discuss it while there, because activity always starts up. I don't go up to my old room alone anymore, ever. I have had witnesses because of this, and I doubt we'd both just so happen to hallucinate the exact same thing, especially when it's two of us silently awestruck at the situation. There's no encouraging the other into the hallucination; we see what occurs, bail out, then discuss wtf just happened.",Kittykg,1686782003.0

travel,"Its been a few years (pre pandemic) since I was in Florence, so specific recs are probably not up to date.

However, note that Italy is a ""new"" country and the traditional cuisines of a particular city/region vary greatly. I always focus on local traditional dishes personally. For Florence its less pasta based and more meat oriented. You might look for places that specialize in florence steak (bistecca alla fiorentina) for example. There are a handful of non-main course things in particular in Tuscany too like Lardo, Caciotta, Zuccotto, and a regional soup (zuppa toscana and also Garmugia and some others I think. The only pasta I can think of would be Pici and Pappardelle, which are eaten with a variety of meats/sauces (ragu, boscaiola, aglione, and others).

If you look for places that don't have any menu or limited menu/website in English (you can use google translate on Chrome or similar) they tend to cater not to tourists, which is often a good sign. Sorry no specific suggestions though.

A: Hi,

Thank you for your interest in GPD Win 4 device. Unfortunetly, GPD has taken 32/1 TB off the production and so upgrade for 2 TB isn't available either. However, It is going to be replaced by GPD Win 4 7840u model in the nearest future. You can subscribe to our email newsletter via our website to stay updated with upcoming releases.

Minimising the risk of legal issues for the government is about how the legislation is designed and can be done IMO. Can‚Äôt get an injunction on the government but can take them to the high court to test their constitutional authority. This doesn‚Äôt stop stuff happening though‚Ä¶

I‚Äôd think you do it as a temporary measure until rates start coming down after inflation stabilises. Blanket rule, no more than 3% increases per annum and grandfathered from prior lease so you don‚Äôt have an incentive to turn over you tenants. Currently rent growth is driving inflation - it‚Äôs counted as a ‚Äòservice‚Äô and is one of the bigger drivers of services inflation.

The economic argument is one about efficient supply. But as a short term measure, price controls will only have an indirect impact on new supply and there easily can be a carve out for new builds which can price to whatever level they want‚Ä¶",GrandiloquentAU,1686781699.0

There is no window to the left of the door on the vestibule in the Sears house, but there is in OPs house

There is no dormer window in the roof of the Sears house, but there is in OPs house.

The roofline of the Sears house is curved whereas OPs house has a straight roof.

Finally, if you look at plans for the Mansfield, the vestibule is centered whereas in OPs it is biased to the left.

This IMO  pretty definitively indicates that this is not a Mansfield.  You might add a dormer as a retrofit, but the whole placement and geometry of the vestibule is entirely different from the Sears house.

glutenfree,"First of all congratulations on going gluten free. It is not easy. And that you feel better is a significant win.

Second, losing weight is hard. I do CrossFit 4-5 days a week. Although I'm not as concerned with how much I weigh - as lean muscle weighs more than fat - I would still like to drop more weight.Tracking your BMI is a better indicator of your health. Even if you are not dropping weight, you are fighting heart disease which is a significant investment in your health. 

I made significant dietary changes in January, namely reductions in Sugar, Carbs, Alcohol. I experienced fairly dramatic results in short period of time and happy to report I have been able to maintain. Again not easy, just reached a point where I was ready to change my lifestyle and retire from my old lifestyle. 

It is different for everyone, but for my money sugar is  the primary culprit. Watch your sugar and carbs. You could be eating 'healthy' and consuming copious amounts of sugar. Most yogurts and certain fruits have a lot of sugar, e.g. bananas, apples. (Berries are good.)

The events and what I saw still occupy my thoughts almost daily and its been 16-ish years.  I think it could have been an abduction that I interrupted, but the rest of the night was a playful and supernatural encounter with mostly sound and it manipulating how we felt, internally, mainly in our mid digestive track. The only physical evidence was the drag marks of the tent as it was being moved and the crinkled corners of the tent that seemed to be held by small hands. The two of us that experienced it, had what seemed to be some poisoning or issue that caused vomiting the next morning. I filed my case with MUFON hoping to get more answers. Years later, before meeting, my wife had a strange glowing encounter in her home and once, when we began dating, we both saw something standing in a home I was renting but it only was there for half a second.

Are you running them from your motherboard? i tried them on my cheap pc motherboard a msi b350 and it sounded thin, no imaging, everything was not there...then i plugged it into my new gaming laptop and they came alive. I suggest you try them on a proper Dac Amp like the ifi zen dac, topping dx1, Ve Megatron or similar and se if you get any improvement in sound. 

 Also as other have said dont expect boomy bass, they are pretty darn flat, it has good bass extension but its controlled and detailed far from boomy. Mids and highs are pretty crisp and on well recorded music like for example Alice in chains Unplugged, Pearl Jam unplugged albums sound amazing on these. Acoustic stuff or quality live recordings are the best for these headphones, hard rock and metal not so much, they are ok for hip hop and edm/ techno. They are very dependent on the type of music and how well was recorded, they tend to highlight flaws like a magnifying glass, if a song is crap then they tend to highlight that but if a song is very well recorded and mastered they sound amazing.  Also keep in mind that being reference and flat they are somewhat bright sounding compared to most headphones. 

On a good source they can sound very holographic, sometimes it gives me that sensation that certain sounds in the music are actully in the room and i have to pause the music and look back lol.",SileDub,1686783558.0

A founder walks in with a vision and nothing else, walks out with working software deployed in prod in about 90 days.

My team does requirement gathering, features, UI/UX , coding, QA, and I even help the founder with fundraising and pitch decks, business model etc. And I connect the founder with other relevant people such as marketers.

OnePiecePowerScaling,"Shounen tropes obvs, Luffy isn't gonna be fighting BB, Im and possibly Akainu too in the same arc

When Luffy fights BB, Zoro will fight Shiryu cause he's the sword guy so when Luffy fights Im, Zoro will fight his no. 2 obvs the gorosei dude with sword

That means whoever he fights last will be stronger than the other. Zoro fighting Mihawk after Luffy has already beaten both BB and Im and therefore solidified his PK- throne in every way is too unlikely  

And the final war happens after One Piece is already found based on WB words, meaning Luffy's already the PK by that war, and the villain of that war is obvs Im-Sama 

Highly unlikely that we'll have to wait an entire arc for Zoro to become WSS after Luffy's already the PK- cause he already found the One Piece in order to start the Final war",warramite,1686788116.0

You could have their battle groups always include one or two and have the entire enemy army be charmed, then have the beast and barbarian factions split allegiances when the hexen all die. This would encourage archer use to snipe the witches.

There is still a problem of a lack of a true backline in such a force, unless the witches got their hands on serpents or ifrits. It might demand a new type of beast with a ranged attack, or maybe give unholds a pack of boulders to toss.

Two weeks prior to the exam, I had taken NBME Form 31 and got 60% (70% in two sections, 48% and 55% in the other two). Took the Free 120 the next day - scored 63%. Then 6 days before my actual exam date, I took Form 28 and got a 55%.

allthemods,"I deal with this by using storage buses and fuzzy card upgrades. I used the storage buses to put some netherite chests from sophisticated storage on my AE network. Then I set filters for armor and weapons of each major type to go to those chests when they're dumped into the network. 

I then took that one step further and networked the chests to a Salvager from silent gears using a subnet with a toggle switch to control the flow. 

So, I come home from adventuring sit my backpack down under an import bus and it imports all my stuff. 

I then screen the items in the chests occasionally for anything I may want. If nothing of value, I flip the toggle and the items then go to the salvager and are destroyed for raw materials and those materials are dumped back into my ME drives. The salvager works for most armor and tools. Great way to get netherite if you're playing on a pack with mobs that spawn wearing high tier armors as this device returns most of the materials to you that the item would cost to make. 

BTW, I used the same approach for some other unique items such as enchanted books, gems, etc; so those get dumped into separate chests. Although the salvager doesn't work for these items,  it gives me a place to screen them without them using up my unique item slots.",Obvious-Stage-1230,1686788965.0

mentalhealth,"I have very good advice for getting good test scores.  
  
If you're suffering from anxiety or depression, I have advice from experts in my comments about standard treatments and self-help.  
  
I've reviewed many books on study. The best I know of are How to Double Your Child's Grades by Schwartz, Helping Your Teenage Student by Cohn and Complete Idiot's Guide to Study Skills.  
  
For remembering course content, the first thing is to take good notes. This is not a skill we're born with. It takes a lot of time to learn doing it right. A source I like very much for how to do things - WikiHow. Read their article on how to take notes. It's great.  
  
From my experience as a uni student, the two most important principles are organization of information and practice.  
  
Write detailed outlines, with phrases, short sentences, and short paragraphs. Keep your lecture and reading notes separate but if you have a really hard test, you can take all your notes and combine them into one big outline. You can even - if it's REALLY hard - make your outline into a set of flash cards and memorize it.  
  
Don't have papers all over the place. Have a filing cabinet or file box. When you don't have time to file things, keep them together with paper clips or folders, stacked neatly.  
  
Don't cram at the last minute. Periodic review during the semester is smart. Another practice method is to occasionally rewrite your notes after class, which makes them better, with more details. Flash cards are useful in a number of ways. I found that I could make the cards work better by adding some mnemonic devices to them - a word or drawing that triggers a memory. The key to mnemonics is having things so weird you can't forget them.  
  
Always study for an essay test and a very good way to do this is to write your own questions and answer them. This gives you a set of phrases and sentences you can use while you're taking the test and you have to hurry.",RWPossum,1686790126.0

DX lenses take advantage of the fact that DX sensors are smaller and don‚Äôt bother with using the extra lens material required to make a FX-sensor-sized final image, they only output the amount of light required for a DX sensor.

ynab,"for the first part, I think that's really what you feel comfortable with. Personally I would also keep my finances separate, but that would also mean having my personal emergency fund that's separate from the business. That makes it easier to think about what you can do in terms of investments on the business side.  


In terms of paying yourself, I would say ideally try not to pay yourself for the first few months and simply see how you're doing, treat it like an investment/savings account.  
You then need to think about what kind of money inflow your business needs in terms of investments/buffer/costs. Whatever is left over is money you can spare. But be careful, because you also need your business to survive something like you being sick for a few months. You don't want to crash and burn at the first setback.  


Really it all comes down to this: Is an hour spent working at your side gig in terms of salary/overhead worth more than your current salary? Then you can start shifting your focus.

MechanicAdvice," If you don't fix 1832 you will end up needing a transmission. It can be caused by passages being clogged, bad pressure control solenoid, Bad wiring, or bad controller can also cause it.

1824 may or may not be related, especially since the code refers to a relay or wiring failure.

Here's the deal- both codes at the same time make me think wiring issue. I would start by physically inspecting the wiring harness, under the hood, fuses, to the trans, the whole nine yards. If there is no wiring issue then check the transmission pressures for the first code and get it fixed first. If the pressures are correct then it could be clogged - - - or its back to the wiring, possibly even a controller. 

In all fairness, this is just the tip of the iceberg to speak as far as diagnosing this. I honestly think this is a case where you will be better served to get it to s competent shop.

HyruleEngineering,"So I did some prototypes (didn't capture video though) and here's a few things I'd like to share.

For reference, the ""practical"" 3 fan fighter can carry 5 weapons (4 Beam + 1 Cannon) on 1 Construct Head.  The practical one has one fan tilted 45 degrees.  From your calculations, it should be possible for a ""practical"" 4 fan fighter to carry 8 weapons, and a 5 fan fighter to carry 11 weapons, as long as it doesn't add another Construct Head.

A 6 fan fighter can have only 13 weapons on a single Construct Head due to the glue limit: 6 fan + 1 Steering Stick + 1 Construct Head = 8 items, the glue limit sets us to 21 items, so only 13 items can be added.

* 5 Fans, with 1 tilted 45 degrees, cannot lift 2x (4 Beams + 1 Cannon) on 2 Construct Heads (10 weapons over 2 turrets).  It just hovers slightly off the ground, with the Cannons hitting the ground.
  * Since a 3 Fan with 1 tilted can carry 5 weapons, then adding 2 more fans should let it carry 6 more weapons (= 11 weapons).  But swapping out one weapon for a Construct Head doesn't get it off the ground, as noted above.  Therefore, a Construct Head is heavier (much heavier?) than a single Beam Emitter.
  * 6 Fans with 2 tilted 45 degrees can lift the above and yields a nice practical fighter/gunship with fast forward dive and slow reverse climb, and can even be landed gently.  But https://www.reddit.com/r/HyruleEngineering/comments/1490cn7/the_ywing_heavy_assault_gunship_maximum_firepower/ beats it in raw number of weapons. (note that the Y-Wing has only 1 Fan tilted).  It does have the advantage of having cannons (necessary against armoured and rocky opponents) with a moderate risk of self-shooting.
* 5 Fans, with 1 tilted 45 degrees, *can* lift 10 Beams + 1 Cannon on 1 Construct Head.  Properly balanced it gets a fast forward dive and slow reverse climb, which I think are good flight characteristics for practical fighters.
  * ***Unfortunately***, putting 11 weapons on a single turret is a really really bad idea.  In a fight, the weapons keep falling off due to the enormous torque the Construct Head apparently can put on them.  In a crash landing --- and nearly every landing is a crash landing --- one or more weapon are likely to fall off, too.  It may be possible to arrange the turret so that weapons don't have too much torque --- I designed my turret to avoid having too many beams near the cannon, and the cannon on an ear of the Construct Head, but that meant that 7 or so Beams were connected to the Turret via one Beam, and while it had minimized midair cannon burst, half the weapons falling off in a fight is just awful.

In conclusion, I think it's not really feasible to exceed 2:1 weapon to fan ratio --- you can't put too many weapons on a turret or else the turret turning will shear off the glue to the weapons, and an extra Construct Head is heavy *and* brings you closer to the glue limit.",raid5atemyhomework,1686794569.0

**AITA for saying no to being my FSIL's bridesmaid?**

My (29F) brother (30M) Tom is getting married to Kim (30F) next spring. I've always liked Kim for Tom, she's supportive of him and kind, and she really appreciates and adores him, I'm very happy for them. I've always found Kim a little excitable (?) for my taste but I'm well aware my taste is irrelevant and I don't see Kim that often as I'm a mom to a young child and I live abroad half the year.

With this context, I was very surprised to arrive home from a trip to find a package from Kim containing a ""bridesmaid proposal"" (is that what they're called?) kit and a handwritten letter from Kim asking me to be one of her bridesmaids. I planned to give her a call within a couple of days to let her know I wouldn't be able to do it, citing a busy schedule and the demands of a toddler. Unfortunately, my husband had a medical emergency the next day and I had to deal with an ungodly amount of admin for the next few days, and it slipped my mind until I was on my way to Tom and Kim's engagement cocktail party at my parents' house.

I wasn't going to say anything about it to Kim that night, but the second I got there she said she was dying to introduce me to the other bridesmaids, and honestly meeting them and hearing about all the activities further cemented my decision. I pulled Kim aside and told her that I wouldn't be able to be a bridesmaid. She snapped, asking why, at which point I calmly told her that while I don't have to explain myself and didn't appreciate her not respecting my answer, I didn't have time to take part in the activities or dedicate any time to planning or helping her. Kim tried to argue it with me, which drew the attention of some of her friends, so they were now listening in, and I again explained to her that I couldn't do it. Kim then snapped that that's just an excuse, and I can make time for things when I want to (referring to the fact that an employee of my husband got married last year and I planned and hosted their wedding) for my friends. At which point I said 'yes, but Kim, you and I are not friends'. Something snapped and Kim began bawling, her intoxicated friends started swearing at me...it was a long night.

There is no consensus on whether or not I'm the AH for not doing it, responses range from whatever Kim's friends were saying, to ""Why did she even ask you"" to everything in between. Tom still wants me to change my mind because he says it would make his life easier but says he won't hold it against me for not taking on the burden, and his opinion is obviously the most important here. It's not that I am holding out just to make his life complicated, I just really don't feel that I can do this and even if I could, I really don't want to. AITA?

ETA - people keep telling me to add this. The time between receiving the box and the party was 1 working week. I got home on Sunday night, received the package. Monday morning, my husband was taken to hospital. I forgot everything that happened before that moment for the next five days, including being asked to be a bridesmaid. My husband was released from hospital on the Friday afternoon, the party was Saturday evening. It was only on my way to the party, having finally had a chance to think about something other than the possibility of my life falling apart for more than a minute, that I remembered the box. I didn‚Äôt deliberately wait until the party to tell Kim.

Recommendation is you can buy sparkplugs from rockauto.com or look up the part number and buy them from amazon. You want Denso which are factory or NGK. Rockauto is great to get information because it will tell you what is good quality to worst quality. The cheapest ones being copper which will not last as long etc.

But these 2 items you should not pay anyone to do.

Air filter as well is a couple of bolts and a clip.

 Battery would not change until it dies.

Would not do coolant flush

Power Steering, would only flush if you notice something not feeling right

Fluid leaks, depending on what fluid leaks just monitor how much fluid is leaking out of each, typically they will get worse but sometimes they just stay negligible.

Transmission fluid it would depend on if you feel like your car is shifting smoothly. If it is then I would ignore it, if it is a little rough a flush could help it",Emperor_of_All,1686793921.0

**AITA for replacing my mother's coffee beans with cocoa krispies?**

So my (16) mom (45) drinks coffee pretty much every day, not even joking. She has several bags of coffee beans and makes them every day. Sometimes she makes coffee in advance for up coming days. I've told her that it's not good to drink coffee every day, but she insists that it's fine.

The other day I decided to play a small joke on her. She always uses one bag of coffee beans until she runs out, then she swaps it for another one. I took an empty bag and filled it with a bag of my cocoa krispies, then swapped it with the bag of coffee beans she had prepared. I didn't think she'd actually fall for it or anything, since the cereal wouldn't weigh the same as the beans. But she actually almost made coffee with it!

When she realized that it wasn't coffee beans she got mad and asked who did this, since sometimes my brother would play a prank on her too. I told her I did, and that I put the actual bag of beans where she always stores them. I didn't think she'd get that mad, but she actually grounded me for the rest of the day.

It's now two days later and she's still mad. My dad insists that it's just the way she is and it's true because she does get mad easily, but I'm starting to feel bad because she keeps bringing it up. Am I in the wrong?


Quick edit: So I just went up to her again to apologize again, and she apologized first. She told me that she wasn't mad at me, she had lashed out because she had an argument with my grandfather over something pretty serious, she didn't say what exactly though. Then she lashed out at me and later at my dad over something he said. She told me she thought my prank was funny and that she'd have to get me back sometime. So I guess this worked out alright in the end.

Edit two: someone called the crisis hotline on me lol. 

Edit three: I've been reading all of the comments and some are mentioning how many cups she drinks. Usually it's all through the day, so it depends. But usually it's like one or two in the morning, two or three in the afternoon, and maybe some in the night?

gamedesign,"I assume this is a junior position, since we're talking about graduates.

I've been a Technical Designer in the past as well as programmer, a more traditional designer and college professor. The first thing I'd look for in an applicant is a project (or more). Even non-professional projects. You can learn quite a few things from what the person did in the past, and the best candidates will always have something to show.

Inexperienced candidates that do not have any interesting projects on their CV tend to be people that gravitate towards a ""path of least resistance"" mentality. People that ticked all the boxes to get a degree and stopped at that.

If they have something interesting listed on the CV, my next step would be to look at the cover letter and see how they talk about themselves. When I applied for TD roles, I used to talk about technical challenges I had to figure out. How I took the game's design or the needs of the design team into consideration when choosing a solution for that.

Even if they don't have any worthwhile anecdotes, the technically minded people will write differently about themselves and what they know. If you have TDs on your team, or even some programmers that are interested in game design, they will be able to smell any BS in the CL.

Not having anything interesting to show, or a interesting CL that denotes some technical knowledge would be an instant pass personally. Having one of the two is not ideal, but I'd be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to someone with a cool project.

I do not agree with the notion that a TD can't showcase their work. The best TDs are prototyping machines that blend the design sense of a GD with the autonomy of a programmer/scripter, they should always have something. If they don't, that's the first red flag.

Also, once you narrow down the list, you can throw them an assignment that forces them to prototype a small game from scratch. Something really simple like an Asteroids clone in your engine of choice with a twist like asteroids with different behaviours, a few poweups and things like that. Something that gives them a chance to build reusable, scalable and intuitive systems, which is what they will be doing in theory.

Another good filter is usually to test programming/scripting knowledge, ideally in real code but also forcing them to write pseudocode for a given feature/system detailed in a design brief. Word the brief in a way that forces the candidate to build the feature in a way that makes it easy to be used by other designers or be extended. This is a much easier and quicker test, and can tell you a lot about the candidate. You can also require them to explain what they did.

I realize both alternatives are more tech-oriented, but that's the best filter for TDs in my opinion. Otherwise your just getting a regular designer.",_MovieClip,1686781086.0

ThatsInsane,">There are literally holes in it. She had to remodel because of a leak and he rebuilt the shower with holes in it, FFS.

The tile isn‚Äôt the waterproofing, grout is porous anyways. There will be a rubber liner underneath everything (who knows if he even put the rubber liner in lol), then a *good* tile installer will add a paint like waterproof substance right under the tile (which this guy did not use). There are also other systems for waterproofing now, but they are all under the tile. 

But yeah, this is awful work. The pictures are the worst shit I‚Äôve ever seen, and I‚Äôve seen better jobs done DIY by homeowners that have never laid a tile on their life. He did them a favor by starting the demo because that‚Äôs a total tear out anyways.

I can't say I've figured out how to find happiness but from my own experiences, it's one of those 'it's the journey not the destination'.

GradSchool,"5th year PhD with ADHD and dyslexia. Honestly? The best way to get through grad school with ADHD and dyslexia is to take medication, mostly for the ADHD. If you are comfortable taking medication and find one that works, you need to be taking it. Honestly I don‚Äôt know how I got through the first three years of my PhD without ADHD meds.

Also, I hate to be the one to tell you but most ADA accommodation in universities is more time on tests. Which doesn‚Äôt really matter in grad school. Accommodations aren‚Äôt going to teach you how to read quickly, and efficiently, which is what all the reading assigned is intended to do. Which, I realize, is doubly hard with dyslexia. I‚Äôve done this myself, and it sucks. I learn best by listening and I‚Äôd recommend that you figure out how you best retain information knowing that you cannot possibly retain all of the information that you were currently reading. Do you learn best by listening? Get the books that you have to read on tape, or have Google docs or a PDF reader read papers to you. Do you learn best by discussion? Look up videos on YouTube about these topics etc. and see if you can find recorded discussions about them. Make a reading group if you can‚Äôt find things online. To get the expertise that I now have in my field, I had to do all of these things while many of my peers were just able to read the papers and retain the information.

You are always going to feel like you were working twice as hard to get just as far as everybody else with your neurodivergencies. That‚Äôs just the way it is. There‚Äôs no easy answer here.

To fix your self-starting and motivation problem, you‚Äôre going to need to figure out how to scare yourself into working ahead because that‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre going to feel like you‚Äôre not drowning. Meds will help with this, but at least where I am, the university doesn‚Äôt make it easy to get medicated again. I really hope this isn‚Äôt the case for you.

Every morning when I get to work, I spend about 10 minutes writing down all of the tasks. I have to complete that day with little checkmarks next to them.

So you can actually go to two different zones from the starting zone. The ruined city can be good for early xp and rogue/dex gear but is very dangerous at a low level. You effectively accidentally skipped an area- though that‚Äôs pretty natural, I think I found that route first too and have read of others having the same issue.

You actually want to go up and left from the starting zone to find a forest area. There‚Äôs a lot of poison in the forest but there‚Äôs also a puzzle right before it that will give you chest armor with nice base defense and poison immunity.  The zone also stretches out a ways south from where you start and you can find a merchant down there. Don‚Äôt go too crazy buying his stuff as it all gets outdated fast, but if you need something crucial to your build (like a whip if you started building dex) it‚Äôs worth it.

Take your time, be patient and get some levels and gear under your belt in the starting area. The enemies feel pretty brutal as is and if you power through to new zones without exploring and getting much xp it will just feel tougher as you go.

poland,">First you thought that Americans trying to apply for Polish citizenship solely on heritage was wrong because they don't speak Polish

I never said it,

I just said that in my personal opinion minimum requirement for citizenship should knowledge of the language.

Because as much as you can live in Cities like Wroclaw, Warszawa, Katowice, Lodz etc... and get away with speaking only English.

Being a Polish Citizen means you are aware of what is happening in Poland because you get all the same rights like everyone else. Otherwise it is just a thing that personally benefit you and you dont care about anything. Which is the entire point of the this post, my comment and the meme.

No one cares about it, it's just funny. It's funny that you get defensive about you trying to abuse the system. It's funny that i tell you that I don't mind it that much, but i do believe in certain restrictions given Security concerns... and those Security Conerns are not just Poland but  European one.

Because the reason why we see the influx of people asking for it is centralization of European Union and how it handles it business. Sponsoring Visa for Americans is still a thing btw...

As for difference of Natural Born Citizen duty vs Earned Citizenship... eh.. What can I tell you. I have no respect to people who don't vote. IT's the one and the only duty you really have as a citizen. Just check wtf is wrong with politics and vote for the party that is the least f\*\*\*ed up. That's democracy at it's finest :)

My automobile is a piece of crap

My fashion sense is a little whack

And my friends are just as screwed as me

I didn't go to boarding schools

Preppy girls never looked at me

Why should they? I ain't nobody

Got nothing in my pocket

Livin' in Beverly Hills

Look at all those movie stars

They're all so beautiful and clean

When the housemaids scrub the floors

They get the spaces in between

I wanna live a life like that

I wanna be just like a king

Take my picture by the pool

Cause I'm the next big thing


Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be

(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)

Livin' in Beverly Hills

Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity

(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)

Livin' in Beverly Hills


The truth is

I don't stand a chance

It's something that you're born into

And I just don't belong

No I don't, I'm just a no class, beat down fool

And I will always be that way

I might as well enjoy my life

And watch the stars play



Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be

raiders,">I'd argue he was an integral part of all those rings, shoulder to shoulder with TB12 and BB. 

There is zero evidence of this. NE did not get better with the addition of McDaniels but saw a noticeable drop (20 spots) with the departure of Brady. Looking at McDaniels body of work, there is zero indication that he has had a positive offensive effect anywhere in his career. 

The STL example is very important as it's the only example of McDaniels as an OC away from both Bill's defense and Brady. The fact that in that stint, he took over an offense that finished 12th the year prior, and he managed 32nd is significant. 

Look at NE last year. They didn't enven employ an OC and managed to finish 17th, that shows you the effect of BB and his defenses.

audio,"Either will work, but an AV receiver has a few advantages since it's designed to work with TVs:

* It will be easier to connect. For audio outputs, most TVs will have HDMI ARC (or eARC, the updated version) and optical digital outputs. Relatively few TVs these have analog audio outputs.
 * An AV receiver will support ARC and optical digital as inputs.
 * Many stereo receivers support neither of these, although some have optical digital inputs. (So in order to get it to work, sometimes you may need a DAC to make the TV's output compatible with the receiver's input.)
* An AV receiver will be easier to control. Most TVs these days have HDMI CEC support, which allows the TV's remote to send commands (like volume up / down) over the HDMI cable to a sound system. An AV receiver will support this. A stereo receiver will not, so you may have to use two separate remotes.
* An AV receiver can decode surround sound. Even though you may not think you'll need this with only two speakers, usually the dialog is encoded on the center channel, and some AV receivers let you boost the dialog even with just two speakers hooked up. Also, you can get a center channel speaker later, if you want one. It might be overkill for a bedroom, but having a separate speaker for dialog makes it easier to understand the words.",adrianmonk,1686784008.0

Daytrading,"> To clarify the first part: By random charts I literally mean a chart  generated by a random number generator (look up random walks). If a  trader can't tell apart a RNG from a real market chart surely you'd  agree there's no way they can profit off of patterns in the market,  right? 

i see what your proposal is now, but now that i've seen it, i have to assume that you don't have much actual trading experience because there is so much information left out in either your [real](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AJorIyLVyPZZSOG30VZq3DrmycJF_fV) or [RNG](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13zLps3lvZs63WpwLkqk881A6meofHmnY/view) charts.  understanding how the y-axis was designed might offer some insight, but if the RNG chart was truly RNG, i would expect the ranges to be far more [sporadic](https://imgur.com/wJf0iKE) and not hover around the the same area.  so on the flip side, i would be very interested in hearing from you why the RNG chart couldn't pass for a real chart, given only the information that you've provided.

in any case, it doesn't really matter because i disagree with your assumption that a trader can't be profitable if they can't tell the difference between the real or RNG charts (that you've provided).  the RNG chart you provided still acts like a real chart, so it can be treated and traded like a real chart if a trader is able to identify a setup within it",Windrosary,1686796683.0

ynab,"TLDR: Used to have about a 50% save rate, but felt miserable. YNAB showed me I can afford to cut that back a little and use my money in a responsible way for the things I enjoy in life.

I was very frugal before, almost too extreme. I worked 35 hrs a week through college at a paid internship for $19/hr. I graduated last year at a good job and stared making $26/hr. 

Not a huge increase, but pretty significant. 

I fed myself on 75-100 bucks a month and saved/started investing while in college.

I wanted to get YNAB to get a clear picture of my finances.

I also was kinda miserable because I felt like I was super broke and unable to afford to do stuff. Yes I know I have a good wage for just starting out, but I still felt underwater.

I really took the ""graduate college and keep living like a broke college kid"" to heart.

With YNAB, I was able to find out my save rate was almost 50%, which is great, but was too much. My save rate was making me feel like I had no money after bills. I couldn't afford to do anything.

With YNAB, I decided to structure my savings, now I have money to allocate to my hobbies, which I wasn't doing through college. Now I have money to go to a concert every few months. Now I have money to take my girlfriend out to eat every once in awhile. 

My save rate is still significantly high, but by allocating $50-$100 to each of those categories every month, I can either let those categories balloon and grow, then make a big fun purchase, or I can sprinkle more frequent little things every month.

For example, we're going to a concert next month. We haven't been to a concert for a while. My ""expensive date activity"" category has gotten constant $75/month allocations for the last few months. I'm able to buy the tickets, fill up my gas tank, and purchase a one night stay in a hotel room (around $350 total) without feeling bad because the money I'm spending was saved a little each month.

YNAB changed my perspective. Before, I would've felt so insecure about spending $350 for 1 single night, but now, I see that that money comes from each paycheck, a little here a little there, and I can be comfortable with it.

YNAB has allowed me to start enjoying my life.",reddeadp0ol32,1686796345.0

cookingforbeginners,"**Parchment paper**, specifically the flat sheets (not rolls), pre-cut to the size of my sheet pans.

I hate dealing with rusting/buckling steel non-stick sheet pans that lose their non-stick-ness. So I use larger aluminum 1/2 sheet pans, and then parchment for non-stickness. 

The problem with the parchment paper sold in most stores, besides being expensive, is that it's sold in rolls, and unlike foil, it has ""memory"" and simply will not ""forget"" it's rolled-up form, and refuses to lay flat. 

Instead, I buy packs of flat sheets of parchment, pre-cut to match the size of my pans. I can grab sheets one-handed, it doesn't fight you by rolling up before you can put something on it.

And if you shop around and compare per-sheet prices, you can get it for pretty cheap. The stuff I bought on Amazon last is $15.99 per 200 sheets, so it's less than 8cents per sheet. The cheapest at Target would be about $0.50 more for the same total square feet, but theirs is a roll, and it's a length that is 1"" shorter than my pan in one direction, and 3"" wider in the other, so it's either incomplete coverage, or wasted over-hang.

And the nice thing about the flat pack boxes is that it's the same size as the pan, so it slots right in the sheet pan cabinet next to the pans, saving space in the foil/wax paper/cling film roll/ziplock bag drawer.

**Little prep bowls and plates**

Cooking always felt like a struggle when there's a lot of ingredients to keep track of. Because it always seemed like a waste of dishwasher space by pre-measuring spices in a cereal bowl, I'd often try to measure *while* I'm cooking, and that makes cooking feel very stressful and rushed. 

One day, I decided I wanted to feel more  ""TV chef-y"", and bought a set of 4 mini glass bowls (like 3"" diameter) from the dollar store, and then 4 coffee-cup-saucer plates from Ikea. 

Wow, what a difference. Having these little dishes to prep all of the spices and seasonings ahead of time really make a huge differences to the pacing of the actual cooking. I've always known about ""Mise en place"", and would use it for, like, the chopped onions and potatoes, but being able to have all of the other ingredients prepped, takes a lot of stress out of the cooking process.  The little plates are also great for spoon/spatula/tongs rests, and hardly take up any dishwasher space, because they can kinda just be shoved in between other things anywhere.",NecroJoe,1686798317.0

In terms of cost benefit for example, a CEO and a zero skills employee with okay salary is quite similar.

Idk if you are a man or not, but a lot of guys actually enjoy ""backbreaking"" (with moderation) work, especially if it's physical, moving heavy things is quite pleasurable, now obviously it would suck if you overworked and got sick and fucked up.

But a lot of men actually do some backbreaking work even for fun, like blacksmithing, woodworking, landscaping, and all of those mancave projects are usually just stupid self inflicted work, but it's fun.",IGotBannedAgain021,1686800478.0

OLED_Gaming,"OLED pixel degradation is progressive; illuminating the same pixel over and over is the same as leaving the same pixel illuminated constantly. This is perhaps worsened if the same pixel that is illuminated over and over is the exact same color, I don't know.

Every pixel that is illuminated is essentially on a death counter with each illumination period equaling a non-refundable next step towards failure. Simply switching any given pixel off before switching it back on does not ""reset"" the death clock.  

Therefore and regarding screen savers, I'd rather have a random and, mostly black screen with a few pixels flying about and in varying degrees of illumination than a group of static images illuminating the entire screen in the same colors and same brightness levels over and over again.

For now, I simply use the ""blank screen"" option when using the TV as a computer monitor and via the microphone on the remote (hold microphone button and say ""blank screen""); it's the only way to be sure.",s1rrah,1686798019.0

F1Manager,"It's not a hard game. You have to sabotage yourself (knowingly or not) in order not to win constantly after 2-3 seasons, no matter the team.

It may give you some further understanding of the rules of the sport, strategy, etc. But it's not a perfect representation, so sometimes things happen not quite exactly as the real life rules.

If you expect a casual management game, you will not be disappointed.

There are plenty of threads that explain the best development strategies and best driver stats. But I'd suggest not to look them up during your first few seasons.

Just a few beginner tips:

You can develop parts without investing Wind Tunnel or CFD hours into them. Some players get confused and think they can't develop anymore after they use all their ATR allocation.

Extra engineers are hired at the Staff tab and don't come automatically from a Design Centre upgrade.

Spending money on expensive facilities is the biggest trap in the first seasons. You can do just fine without upgrading the Wind Tunnel and CFD facility for a while.

Body:  

Qualifications: 10th -86, 12th -74, UG- 66%, PG- 70% 

As you can see my quals are not up to the level of many posts in this sub. But to tell you about me, from the beginning, I think of myself as a smart guy with a desire to learn. I have completed my Btech and MBA from both tier 2 colleges and currently working with an MNC with a good package. 

But still, I feel that I am not contemptuous of my current level of education. I have smart friends who are doing MS from NYU or MBA from Pen. Heck, my Ex is currently doing MBA from Rotman and just got her internship finalized in McKinsey. 

I also want some elite credentials on my resume, Workex of top companies like MBB. I am fed up with being Mediocre. 

For this, I blame our education system. Being a single child with working parents I had little to no guidance as to what are my options for the future. Nobody told me to be 9/9/9 in everything I do. From the beginning I chose things without any plan, I studied PCMB to become a doctor but ended up in Engineering. After that, a decent cat score and I took out a loan to complete my MBA. 

You see if I have some guidance about my future anything, I would have taken easy subjects to get better 12th results, have easily gone to DU to pursue some ‚Äúcool and diverse‚Äù courses and would have prepared for IIMs.

Edmonton,"One thing to consider if financing  a car is that while the dealer may say (as they did when we ourchased our last vehicle) that you can't pay off the line for at least 6 months, we did so by simply walking into the bank they made the financing arrangements through the next week and paid it off.  Knowing the terms of financing matters.  The longer you take to pay the loan down, the more the dealership (and bank) is compensated via interest earned.",BugsB66,1686801270.0

If you compare the 2 sets of pics side by side, you'll see the difference.

Lowes,"Wowüò≤!!! I haven't been able to take a ""break"" besides my lunch and sitting down in the training room for about five minutes while I process my reports in about a year.

State mandated breaks? I would be lying if I said I wasn't jelly. Unless you have a job with federal mandated rest periods (ie: truck transport, aviation) Indiana, the state I live in, made it clear that it was not the state's obligation to mandate employers to give employees over the age of 18 lunches or breaks. Having  a bargaining agreement changes that too. The only requirement is if an employer does offer a break less than 20 minutes, it has to be paid. That's a Federal one.

I've been that cashier before that was forced to stay late and it sucks. Once again, in Indiana, unless you have collective bargaining agreements at your job (I don't know any Lowe's that has a union), it's tough fight. I would have a convo with the FEDS, then the Admin ASM. Seems like you have a lot more to lean back on than I would if it was me in the same situation.

dbz,"> If it wasn't a timeline of Canon events it would include non canon movies but it doesn't. Both Akira and Shueisha say that GT is canon. Shueisha being Akira's publishing company. The biggest reason people don't think it's canon is because it isn't made after a manga but the Dragon Ball Manga company itself, Shueisha, says it's canon so. Look at the Shueisha Timeline that was updated to match Akira's in 2022. Why would a Manga company that doesn't have the movies on the timeline because they didn't have manga of them have GT on it's timeline when GT doesn't have a Manga either? It's canon.
 
 Actually, no. Toriyama has never said that it was canon, and Shueisha has quite clearly said that it *isn't* canon on multiple occasions, such as them saying that Gogeta's appearance in the 2018 Broly movie was his first appearance in canon.

 Likewise, GT takes place within the continuity of those Z movies, hence Coola's appearance, the Ryu-ken, etc.

> Lastly base power levels can change. Goku's base super Saiyan became the power of super Saiyan god after he became super Saiyan god for the first time. Who knows how strong base Goku is after SSB and Ultra Instinct. To add Vegeta handled base Broly fine as Base Vegeta. Broly then used the power of the great ape to power up which Vegeta needed to go super Saiyan god to get a handle over. Broly then went super Saiyan while using the power of the great ape which beat both SSB Goku and SSB Vegeta. But base strength Vegeta was actually stronger and Broly needed a power up.

 No, it wasn't just him becoming the Super Saiyan God that caused it to happen. Goku absorbed/merged with the power of Super Saiyan God at the time, incorporating that into his new base (although this was seemingly retconned with his later use of Super Saiyan God). He didn't just become stronger because he reached that form. That's never been how it worked.

 No, Vegeta was being overpowered by Broly while a Super Saiyan, and transformed into God after. *Then*, Broly transformed into his Wrathful state to combat it. He was already well above Vegeta's Super Saiyan form while in his regular base form.",vlorsutes,1686798174.0

I didn't see any added clause about rent review after 12 months, only ""at the end of the current contract,"" which is now 24 months which it states at the opening of the contract.

Thank you for all this good info. I will definitely gather the numbers for when this comes up again in the future. As for the upgrades, it is the ECO4 scheme. They give grants for low-income households, whether you own the home or not. It is meant to help with the increasing energy prices. And if we moved homes and had to rent a new property, we would be able to take advantage of the scheme all over again at the new property, so that's why it isn't really much of a risk for us on losing out on the upgrades.

But I completely agree that it is really ungrateful of the LL to ask for an increase after all that. He seems like a really nice guy so we were really let down by him doing so. But at least we know there won't be another increase for 2 years now.

l4d2,">How do I get into VS lobbies with competitive folks who don‚Äôt leave after 1 round?

Depends what you're looking for. There are competitive servers that fundamentally rebalance the game to be more fair and balanced, such as [CedaPug](https://cedapug.com/) and [L4D2Center](https://l4d2center.com/), where there are various rules against ragequitting.  
These, however, also have decently high standards, so you'd be expected to be well-versed in the game before joining.

If you want to play vanilla versus, there's some smaller communities that try to be fair and fun without losing track of the competitive nature of the mode. These tend to be on Discord, and privately share invites on a per-person basis.

>Is there an objective difference to any of the melee weapons?

There's a few differences between the melee weapons.

* **Sharp, Blunt, and Shredding properties**  
Each melee falls into one of these 3 categories.  
Sharp and shredding are functually the same, the only difference is that shredding has some additional gore.  
Sharp melees are objectively better than blunt melees, because they are able to cut smoker tongues (a useful skill in Versus) and are more effective at dealing with hordes.  
This is because blunt melee weapons make common infected play a death animation upon impact, during which the infected retain collisions, so any follow-up hits will end up hitting the dying common. This also makes it harder to push through a horde.  
Sharp melees on the other hand cause infected to ragdoll and lose collision instantly, allowing you to kill larger swaths of a horde and push through groups more effectively.
* **Attack speed**  
Some melees can attack in faster succession than others. The fastest melee is the nightstick, closely followed by the machete. The slowest melee is the Shovel.
* **Attack direction**  
The direction the melee swings in can vary quite a lot. The fireaxe for example has only horizontal attack directions, whereas the baseball bat has 2 diagonal swings with only the last swing being horizontal. Generally, horizontal swings are easier to handle, with any other swing direction requiring more skill and conscious effort to compensate for.
* **Attack pattern**  
Similar to the attack direction, some melees have more individual swings than others. The knife for example only swings in one direction every time, whereas the Machete has 3 different swings (alternating left to right and right to left).
* **Hitrays**  
A hitray is basically a line drawn from your eyes outwards when you attack, which acts as a brief hitscan to check whether you hit something. The game does this a couple of times throughout a melee swing, with different melees having different amounts of hitrays.  
The shovel for example has around 30 per swing, whereas the nightstick only has around 8. The higher the amount of hitrays, the more consistently hits will register, and melees with lower hitray counts are often subject to making an impact sound, but not actually killing anything.
* **Swing time**  
The amount of time an individual swing lasts for. The longer it is, the more hitrays it typically has. This is a very small difference, with the fastest average swing duration being 0.67s (nightstick) and the slowest being 0.98s (shovel), making for a easy-to-overlook difference.
* **DPS against tanks**  
Tanks will always die in 20 hits from a melee weapon, no matter the difficulty. This means that you can calculate the DPS of a melee weapon against tanks. The highest is the nightstick with 304, and the lowest is the shovel with 205.  
You're almost never going to be meleeing a tank long enough for this to matter, but it's still a difference in stats, resulting mainly from the attack speed and swing duration.
* **Spawn frequency**  
Not every melee will spawn in every campaign. For example, the fireaxe cannot spawn in The Parish, and the Machete can't spawn in Dead Center.  
This is mostly trivia, since you're always guaranteed to find at least one of the best melees in each campaign (Fireaxe, Katana, Machete, or Crowbar).
* **Swing-shove delay**  
This aspect is pretty straightforward; When you swing the melee weapon, there is a short delay before you can shove afterwards. For some melees this delay is slightly shorter than for others.

General consensus among players is that the ***Fireaxe*** is the best melee weapon, due to it's high amount of hitrays, consistent horizontal swings, sharpness, and the fact that it is the 2nd most frequent melee in the game, spawning in 12 out of 14 campaigns.  
The ***Machete*** is another top contender, favored by players who prefer speed over consistency, as it has less hitrays but a faster attack speed.  
The ***Katana*** sees more casual preference, since it's a middle-ground between the Machete and Fireaxe, excelling in nothing but being decent at everything makes it easy to use by pretty much anyone.  
The ***Crowbar*** is a more niche choice, as it's on the slower side with the lowest average hitrays out of every melee weapon, but it makes up for this by having the shortest delay between swinging and shoving, which makes it the best choice for pushing through hordes.

&#x200B;

>I always see YouTube videos of folks with different modded skins, why don‚Äôt I see that in my campaign/vs lobbies?

Mods in the game are client-side, that means only the person who has them installed can see them.  
The exception to this is scripts and plugins, which can be hosted directly on a server and modify everyone's game. This can only be done on third-party servers or local servers, so you won't ever encounter this on official Valve servers.",Jaiz412,1686795546.0

Eastern Ratsnakes are more likely to have a yellow base color and stripes. *Pantherophis* ratsnakes are keeled-scaled generalists that eat a variety of prey. They do well in urban environments, and are particularly fond of rodents and birds in these habitats.

Eastern Ratsnakes are currently recognized as distinct from Central Ratsnakes *P. alleghaniensis*, as well as Western Ratsnakes *P. obsoletus*. Parts of all three species were once generically labeled ""black ratsnakes"". Use the ""!blackrat"" command without the space for more on these changes.

Ratsnakes can be easily distinguished from racers *Coluber* by the presence of keeled scales. Racers have smooth scales.

*P. quadrivittatus* likely evolved in peninsular Florida and is tied to the Atlantic Coastal Plain, so coastal areas are home to *P. quadrivittatus* while Central Ratsnakes *P. alleghaniensis* occupy the higher elevations inland, up off the coastal plain. The two likely heavily exchange genes.

Eve,">Do you think the existing nullsec blocs are so entrenched that only stuff like internal fighting/rogue director could dislodge them, or could other groups still defeat them with conventional fighting?

The only way you can get rid of the existing null blocs would be through internal strife.  One of the aspects that sets Eve apart from other games is that for some players, the group they belong to is part of their identity.  They can't imagine belonging to another group.  They can't imagine not being part of their current in-group.

Most people find it very difficult to change their current in-group in real life.  Normally, it takes some life altering event for this to occur.  I won't say it will never happen in the world of Eve Online; but, I'd say the odds are extremely low.

And if you can't get these people to break away from their 'in-group', they are going to fight for their 'in-group'.  And since you can't really completely destroy the 'in-group' (because people don't really die in Eve), they are always going to have that 'in-group' to be part of.

This is basic psychology, really.",Severe-Independent47,1686808121.0

However I‚Äôm curious what you would say about this. That middle gap in your numbers is huge. 25-168k. That feels like it could totally obscure people getting substantially poorer. For example, sure, more people are extremely wealthy however in that 67% of wealth in the middle perhaps 50% of that is comprised of people who were making 168k and are now making 25.1k ergo a ton of people would have gotten substantially poorer. Even the distribution of those numbers is weird for comparison purposes without seeing it on a histogram. If it was a normal distribution fine then we‚Äôve proved more people are skewed to the right than there used to be but for the average person we‚Äôre still really not sure how well they are doing compared to how well people in the past were doing which is the main concern of the original poster.

**AITA for being frustrated at a lycra warrior?**

On out way home tonight I took a slightly more scenic route, partly through some 'proper' country lanes. In England, the stereotypical type that zigzag between fields and are only wide enough for one car, with high hedgerows either side.

I came up behind a 'Percival Pedalsworth' who obviously decided that today would be the day to stand up for his rights as a user of the Kings highways. I gave him plenty of space at first, but after a while I got a little closer (still a safe distance of course) and stayed in a low gear to make it obvious I wanted to pass. He looked at me over his shoulder a couple of times, so he knew I was there and I didn't want to harass him by beeping or anything.

Over almost 4 miles this prick passed every passing place, field entrance or wider corner without slowing or moving over. I got pretty frustrated, complaining that this is how cyclists end up getting knocked down, by being inconsiderate of holding up other road users. My partner took his defence though, stating that he has as much right to be on the road as us.

Am I the asshole for being impatient to pass, or is he the asshole for not being considerate enough to give me a safe opportunity?

- Use elpy to send Python code to inferior interpreter.

Your code is almost similar to mine, so you must think inside the loop. You are opening files and not closing them. You only close one time outside the loop. So you must check what condition you have to implement to close the files you are opening one by one.

I hope this helps you find your way. You can also join on cs50 discord, it will help too.",PirataMaluco,1686791123.0
9anime,"#Hello user, you mentioned the word Ban or Banned and as such I have been summoned.

If you're having an issue regarding **comment bans** (NOT THE WHITE SCREEN) on the site, please contact Sorrow-San or try accessing our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KRQQKzQ6CS) and asking in there.

If your issue is related to Discord specific bans, please ignore me and proceed as usual.

&nbsp;

**And now for the big one.** If you're getting messages regarding a one hour ban from 9Anime then please take note of the following information.


0. If you're a mobile device user then please ensure that your adblocker isn't blocking amung.us as that can apparently cause a false positive sometimes with the firewall's protection scheme. If you're using the filter lists available then that should already be applied, otherwise, make sure you add a custom filter of `@@||amung.us^` to the user filters section of your adblocker.

1. Some people have mentioned receiving a ban for no reason, these cases are being noted as staff continues to fine-tune their filtering efforts. And they're sorry for any mess such false-bans have caused. Trust me, they're hard at work to ensure users aren't falsely banned.

2. Any method of accessing 9Anime besides the use of a web browser may trigger the firewall and ban you for an hour. Third party applications actively hurt the site and make it neigh impossible to maintain, so any use of them will continued to be blocked.

3. Bans only last an hour, after which they'll be lifted. You shouldn't ever be banned forever, and the ban time will not stack (at this time) with repeated offenses. It can, however, be re-applied should whatever triggered the ban in the first place still be detected.

4. [Properly configured Adblockers](https://www.reddit.com/r/9anime/comments/c330dx/ublock_origin_filter_fixes/) should not and so far have not triggered these bans. 9Anime doesn't ban you for using an adblocker, as they understand how much of a mess some of these advertisements can be. (Although they would still prefer if you could at least allow sidebar ads through as those are the ones that actually support the site)

5. In the event of receiving this issue MULTIPLE times in a row, please try contacting staff directly at `9anime.team@gmail.com` to report your issue.

It sounds like one option is to net the two figures through the software to report the net (correct) income, but if I do that it seems like I could be in an Information Mismatch situation, where the state has a copy of the incorrect 1099 and my return just shows the net figure.

There is also the Speedmaster Mark II and III that sell for less. Look at all Speedmaster models and find the one calls you. 

I always wanted a Moonwatch but when I saw the Speedmaster Mark II with Racing dial I was hooked. I now have 5 Omegas and still no Moonwatch. If your heart is set on achieving your goal of Speedmaster ownership then let nothing or no one stop you.

I do think that's where the unique part of this hero comes in, because with my tweak, it actually forces her to be a must-commander for her playstyle which isn't necessarily bad because you can build a worthwhile loadout behind it. But with the current +damage+attack speed, it will leave little to nothing for creative loadout ideals.

Nevertheless I agree, there's a power scale issue in the numbers but don't forget it's contingent on that constant motion; means that accuracy will be less, will force a playstyle that currently isn't prominent in the game.",AuveLast,1686804931.0

LetsTalkBam,"I really dislike his eyes in this video. He always tries to be a badass but in this one his eyes are just crazy as fuck. If you see the entire video he just changes the subject randomly. He is talking about how he gets to see Phoenix and then the next second with no rhyme or reason he changes it to fighting Knoxville. I think the ""crazy eyes"" are a mark of the brain damage inflicted on him with his dumb stunts. Sometimes the pupils being platter sized like that is a definitive indication of damage and not simple drug use.

He would get wrecked by someone in a real fight with no one around. One of my favorite videos to watch of Bam's is the one in Sweden/Europe where he gets punched and just stands there and the guy walks up to escort him out after he has already hit the ground and takes 5 steps towards the door and drops right to the floor again. He hit this women and the guys defended her and he takes about 6 to 9 shots to the head rapidly that for someone that doesn't like him I will admit it is funny. The simple cost of being an asshole.

He talks about being a professional asshole and even mentioned on the Dr. Phil video that he likes being knocked out and the way it makes him feel. Seriously? One. That is not good for the damage it inflicts on the brain and Two. It is such a childishly ignorant way to view things. I've seen people have several accidental concussions and it can really mess with you later in life and is not FUN nor is it something to look forward to.",BobRossPaintByNumber,1686808372.0

 Welcome to ProRevenge! Unfortunately, your story has been removed because your account is very new. While we allow the use of throwaway accounts, the overwhelming majority of posts from new accounts either aren't pro or violate our [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/about/rules/).  Please read the following and carefully consider whether your post is Pro Revenge or not (specifically, whether *other* people will consider it pro revenge or not) before you take further action.  
 
**To be considered Pro Revenge, your revenge must go *well above and beyond* what a normal average person would do or is expected to do in your situation**, using significant planning, cleverness, dedication, cunning, persistence, etc in order to achieve an effective revenge.  
 
If your story takes place at school, it almost certainly belongs in /r/Schoolyardrevenge, not /r/prorevenge.  
If the only consequence of your revenge is temporary embarrassment, please consider posting it in /r/RegularRevenge or /r/PettyRevenge (after you read their own rules of course).    
If your revenge was primarily enacted through recommended legal options, such as reporting prohibited behavior to an authority figure, your post almost certainly belongs in /r/RegularRevenge.  Simply telling a supervisor, teacher, or police officer that you were harmed is not by itself Pro Revenge.  
 
If none of the above applies to your post, you can submit a modmail and request a manual review.  In it, please certify that your post follows all the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/about/rules/), then explain (BRIEFLY) how you were wronged, what your revenge was, and what makes it pro.  **If you do not include this explanation in your modmail, your post will NOT be reinstated.**  You can submit a modmail [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/ProRevenge).

A few thoughts:
- You can definitely call yourself an investor/asset manager. You probably have a good understanding of the topic and is partially true.
- I don't know how hard it will be to settle somewhere, but I know your costs will fall a lot if you manage to find a good place to rent or own instead of living in Airbnb's.
- we usually only look at greener pastures. I am sure that if you moved back home you would be able to find a new job and start rebuilding not too far behind from where you left off. If this is proving to be the best alternative to you I would seriously consider it. It is easy to believe in the sunken cost falacy in your situation, but I know how hard it can be to stay away from family and old close friends for such a long time.

libraryofruina,"SPOILERS 
So, in a couple of bullet points about your questions

1. Reverb is all dead, during the before last battle, all of their defeat animation or all unqiue as this time they aren't being booked but dying

2. (Maybe, can't remember, been a while) If i recall, this gets answered or explained somewhat in the webcomic, Leviathan. From what i recall (and this can be incorrect) its explained that Carmen got to see the future in order to topple the HEAD, Ayin and Carmen's plan (they intead to change the city therefore against the HEAD) BUT she finds out that in order to do that, its gonna cause a lot of death which Carmen REFUSES so she becomes the voice of the light which causes distortions

3. About Purple Tear, Iori. Right now, that's all we know about her in LOR, but in a deleted ending in LOR (maybe not canon now) she shows up in a meeting and purposes a new wing a L Corp Wing creation which may imply that Limbus Company is being sponsored by Iori. Also you can see her in Leviathan.

4. This one is tricky. Roland and Angelica are BOTH the Black Silence, the reason why is that due to Angelica strength and Roland's mask. Because no one knew the actual color, which is Angelica due to Roland's mask warping perception and the gloves muffling sound, they thought the guy in the mask, Roland was the Black Silence which he used after her death along with her gloves. But yeah, Angelica IS the Black Silence, but IMO pretty sure that Roland has color potential.

5. Yeah, the nuggets, spehirot, Angela, and Roland are blacklisted in the outskirt, and if they re-enter the city, they are gonna get mobbed by the HEAD And that's the current lore on the library so far.",RevernAd,1686799834.0

I really dislike the fact that the discourse is either ""Mori and Studio Gaga are saints and can do nothing wrong"" vs ""Mori and Studio Gaga are an insult to Miura's memory"". No in-between, no nuance. It's unfortunate that online discussion boils down to either you love it or hate it.  I appreciate their attempt immensely, and again, I'm really happy that I get to know what happens next. We've gotten some great art out of the continuation as well.

It's just that I don't agree with every decision of theirs, by far, and sometimes I feel like a crazy person, both here on the subreddit and on sk.net, because somehow I fell in the middle of both.

If a witness sees someone shoot you first, you shouldn't get a wanted level.

If you antagonised them into shooting at you, fine have it hit your honour, flipside if they started the antagonising (say, by being rude to your greeting) you shouldn't lose honour by giving them some lip back.

If a witness comes along and sees you with a body, fine go and fetch the law, but there should be a reasonable chance you can talk your way out of it when they arrive.

Hauling (dead) bodies on your horse shouldn't get as much scrutiny from passers by as it does, maybe a lawman would question it but if you didn't do the killing you should have a high chance of talking your way out of it (low but not zero if you DID kill them).

OCD,"I'm sorry and I can really understand the frustration for you and the difficulty for your partner. Firstly, I think it's important to know that your partner has not given up on trying to improve and is taking steps towards it. I think the therapist should be very interested in trying to get the ball rolling on that. While such compulsions wouldn't seem easy to address, I think that's in part because you can come to think they're just too quick and involuntary. But it seems they're not entirely involuntary, as they don't do it under some circumstances, like in public. So the sense I get is that while they're repetitive and habitual, they really can be withheld.

Here's some of my thoughts about how that might happen:

* underlying thoughts, beliefs & concerns related to it might be better addressed - the compulsions might be a stress reaction based on contamination themes, for example
* your partner can practice withholding - response prevention might start deliberately for small, controlled amounts of time and advance to specific situations, withhold it
* your partner would have to withhold the compulsion until the urge passes and they return to normal, do it gradually and build up to longer, and increasing the circumstances
* if they could just quit cold turkey, that would be good, but wouldn't seem likely - encourage your partner to set goals and practice daily",LoremIpsumDolor875,1686808961.0

pokemonmemes,"Honestly I'm losing trust in Pok√©mon. They charged DLC for Sword/Shield, a decent amount of people were outraged (myself included), then BDSP and Legends Arceus had no DLC, not even free DLC, so I thought we were in the clear and they'd finish games again (though BDSP should've been a warning they wouldn't), then Scarlet and Violet came out which while fun, has plenty of problems already, then they charged us DLC again. Breaking trust with your audience is a fast and easy way to lose money, but they don't seem to care.

As someone who grew up with Pok√©mon, having it as one of my favorite game series, I hate to see what's happening to the series. I don't want to hate these games, but the best I can say about the series right now is ""I guess it's a fun time killer"" and ""that's a neat Pok√©mon design"". I hate to say it, but if they keep up like this I feel the series could start dying.
I'm fine with two separate versions, and I'm fine being charged full price, but only if they finish their game.

Sorry for the long rant, but when my favorite series starts giving payed DLC to clearly unfinished games I'm just upset. I'm willing to wait longer for games as long as their finished, but they don't seem to intend on listening to fans any time soon.",Auramaster151,1686814277.0

CVS,"Our store was the district pilot for using ACOs as our main registers, according to our SM. If you get employees trained right on them, one of you can operate two ACOs simultaneously and mow through twice to thrice the customers as in the same amount of time at the traditional registers.

The way our crew works is we have the CEC/Green Zone Captain who uses the ACOs as registers. If even one person has alcohol/MoneyGram/card reload, the CEC calls for backup to ring them out while still focusing on the ACO customers. 

When it works well, this is actually great because it keeps our lines moving quickly. But when the ACOs meltdown, like they always do, OR if there's a coupon snag, like there always is, things go south quickly. That's before the hours cuts meaning 1) now a shift/manager is alone for a mandatory 2.5-3 hours per working day, usually at our busiest times because ""demand"" is a fucking farce, and 2) people who were at 20 hours a week are now down to 5 and don't remember how to do half their jobs OR call for backup.

But real talk I swear to christ if I hear one more customer complain ""where's the checker"" when i'm standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM and have offered to ring them out on the ACOs, I will SCREAM.

Gojo, again, always had 6 eyes and Limitless but never fully mastered it, until after Toji fight, and still has room to grow.

serialkillers,"Macdonald Triad is an unsubstantiated theory. There is evidence that any one of the triad behaviors could predict future violent offending, but it is very rare to find all three behaviors together as predictors. Thus, the empirical research on the MacDonald triad does not fully substantiate its premise. Rather, it would appear that the triad, or its individual constituents, is better used as an indicator of dysfunctional home environments, or poor coping skills in children. Future research is needed with robust and rigorous methodologies (e.g., adequate control groups, longitudinal designs) to fully establish the MacDonald triad's validity. So, you likely won't find any true examples that would exhibit all three elements in a single serial killer as a predictor, because there's no evidence it is a predictor of being a future serial killer.

HunterXHunter,"I personally think there‚Äôs a difference between forgetting one‚Äôs humanity and becoming a monster. We see examples of the former everyday, especially on Reddit; people wishing death on criminals regardless of circumstances. That sort of thing.
But those people haven‚Äôt become monsters- they‚Äôve committed no crime and arguably harmed no one with their words and there is at least some reasoning behind it, even if it‚Äôs paper thin. 

Gon is in a similar boat; he‚Äôd set out with a righteous cause to avenge the apparent torture and continued, undignified torment of his mentor and when, finally, after a very long, frustrating journey, he was able to confront the legitimate monster responsible, he finds that not only has Pitou begun showing signs that they weren‚Äôt *quite* the 100% evil pos he had previously known, but she was also in the process of saving some random girl‚Äôs life.
After all he‚Äôs gone through to then be so close to his goal only to be denied at the last second and be shown that things weren‚Äôt as simple as he had always thought they would be was so unthinkable and galling that he forgot his humanity; threatening to kill the unconscious Komugi, a completely innocent bystander throughout the entire arc, if Pitou didn‚Äôt do exactly as he said to the letter and reach a point where they could ‚Äòfree‚Äô Kite and have their final showdown.
In my opinion, even at this point he‚Äôs still no monster, but he did forget his humanity. Later on when he finally gets to fight Pitou and turns into a superhuman, ‚Äòmonstrous‚Äô version of himself, he still hasn‚Äôt become an actual monster, just in body.

You know as I‚Äôve written this I‚Äôve come to another realisation; A true monster would have killed Komugi regardless of circumstances just to get to Pitou. It was Gon‚Äôs humanity that stayed his hand and gave Pitou the chance to fix her. So yeah, Gon is no monster, nor did he ever become one, but he definitely lost himself for a time.",Furitaurus,1686815525.0

suns,"The four players mentioned.

1. Emoni Bates - Wing. 6'8 height, 179 lbs, 6'9 wingspan. 19 years old. (Another report says 195?)
2. Markquis Nowell - Point Guard. 5'8 h, 160 lbs, 6'0 ws. 23 yo.
3. Desmond Cambridge Jr - Guard. 6'4 h, 180 lbs, ~6'7 ws. 24 yo.
4. Tanner Groves - Center - 6'10 h, 240 lbs, ? ws. 24 year old.

Emoni probably has the best potential of the four, especially at 19 years old. Development under the tutelage of Booker and KD will bring out his potential, or lack thereof. https://www.nbascoutinglive.com/emoni-bates-scouting-report/

Markquis looks to be a great play maker, but that build is very concerning. CP3 is 4 inches taller and is considered small. He will get targeted to death. But as CP3 proved, you can still be effective on defense. But few are. If undrafred, would like to see on the Suns G League team (soon) as the assists and free throw % (~90) are enticing. https://www.nbascoutinglive.com/markquis-nowell/


First time hearing of this Desmond. Nothing jumps off the page outside the one highlight. Combo guard is always nice and could be a compliment to Booker in the future? https://www.nbascoutinglive.com/desmond-cambridge-jr/


Tanner has an amazing beard. Max him. But anyway, he is basically a younger Jock with almost an identical profile. And a great beard. I'll let you judge, but I kind of like what I'm seeing. And not just the beard. https://www.nbascoutinglive.com/tanner-groves-scouting-report/",ajteitel,1686812484.0

Off the top of my head, I'd anticipate potentially slower mod response times when it comes to removing dumb flyby posts and approving legitimate posts/comments that get caught in the automod karma filter. In my time as a mod thus far, we haven't had a big spam problem, and the automod filter we have does a good job at catching the spam that I have seen.

We might also lose community members who decide that they'd rather not stick around on Reddit anymore in light of the recent events surrounding the API changes or become unable to use the site due to accessibility limitations.

It appears that this may be a post regarding a medical concern, due to the sensitive nature of medical advice the mod team manually screens health posts for approval. r/puppy101 mods may comment and lock or remove a post if it is clear that the only appropriate answer is to seek emergency care or the question cannot adequately be answered here, otherwise there may be a slight delay in approval. In an emergency situation, the most important thing to do is to remain calm and work to get your pet help. If your primary care veterinarian cannot see an emergency, the best way to find a nearby emergency facility is to do a web search for ""[your location] emergency vet"", ""[your location] animal hospital"", or ""[your location] animal emergency"". Whenever possible, calling ahead may help a facility to better prepare for your arrival. Additional online resources can be found here- https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/healthresources .Thank you for making it through to the tail end. We hope you and your pet can get the help they need and everyone is feeling better soon!

There's flat out no plausible mechanism by which you could become better than a physician at being a physician by purely doing non physician tasks.

You're not being exposed to more experienced instructors or higher level expertise. 

You whittle it down and at the end of the day all midlevels really have is their unfortunate, arrogant comfort with their profound ignorance, and whatever medical skills and knowledge are able to be transferred by osmosis while they were working at the bedside during their preliminary career. Which is zero.

It's bullshit and nobody ever calls them out on it. Midlevels love to talk about what the medieval medical standards of care were 200 years ago, but at the end of the day, when asked to explain the trajectory of their own expertise in the modern era, they can't.

This goes beyond sexuality, it‚Äôs about people making a character be someone they‚Äôre not in any form or fashion, writers are in control of their characters, they are the say all be all of their character, your opinion on the character doesn‚Äôt matter, it doesn‚Äôt change who they are, like I said make your fan art, have your fantasies, but a character is who they are written to be simple as that.

Divorce,"Legally....the wife needs to realize that the bank account isn't ""his money"".  It's ""ours"".  She just doesn't have the password to access part of her property.  

She should call around a bit and find an attorney who will do a free consult.  They exist.  She doesn't need the ""best"" attorney because this stuff isn't all that complicated.

My best guess is the filing for divorce would also include an emergency order for her to be able to access that account and (a) learn how much money is there and (b) take some of it.  

The other thing the wife needs to do is find a job.  I'm not saying this to judge SAH parents, but I think they're making a HUGE mistake when they make that choice.  It only works if they stay married for ~20 years.  It varies by state, but that's when they start to get the right to lifetime alimony.  But when they divorce when the kids are little, they just get a few years.  They often didn't have much of a career before the kids (which is why it was a choice to leave the workforce) and now they have to restart as a working Mom with a gap in their resume.  Not an easy task.....which is why I think it's a mistake to choose that path.  But she has to work so she can support herself so she can support her kids 50% of the time.  

She'll probably have an instinct to push for full or majority custody, but I honestly think it's not a bad idea to let the Dad be saddled with the kids for a few years while she gets her career moving again.  

The affair probably doesn't matter legally and if there's a kid involved, it's just another kid the Dad will owe child support on.  

Sorry for the wife in this situation, but it doesn't have to be a really complicated divorce.  There's not enough money to be worth fighting over.  Custody probably defaults to 50/50.  If the Dad is willing to actually modify his job to be a single dad every other week, he can get 50/50.  So if he seems willing to do that, the wife should drop it and settle on 50/50 because she won't win and will just waste money fighting.  If he can't/won't do that, then she gets the kids more and child support will go up.  But it's not rocket science.",dogs94,1686818716.0

Swingers,"> This isn‚Äôt one of those ‚Äúhow do I get my gf to be a swinger posts‚Äù because she‚Äôs not my girlfriend.

Yes, it is.

> For the record, I‚Äôm not looking to jump into LS with her until we‚Äôve been going steady as a couple for several months, or maybe even a year. I don‚Äôt want to rush into it until our connection has deepened

Further, it's one of those ""she told me no but I think she really should mean yes, and I'm going to bait and switch her by pretending to be mono and then try to talk her into swinging"" posts.

You're trying to put a marker down on swinging so that when you bring it up later you can defend yourself against the bait and switch. 

""No, honey, remember that one time when I whispered the word swinging to you?  So this shouldn't be a surprise!""

She comes at relationships with a view of long-term monogamy, and you want to deliberately allow her to make decisions from this mindset while secretly knowing that long-term monogamy is not on the table for you.


Let's review:

* She doesn't do hookups
* She doesn't do FWBs
* She's from a religious background
* You think she has feelings that limit her sexuality, just like most people.
* You haven't even told her that you swing.

This girl is *almost perfect* except for this major incompatibility, so you want to make her compatible so she can be the perfect girl for you.

This isn't the way to do it. If you want to do this ethically, you need to bring up now that ""idk that I could go back to pure monogamy.""

That is a highly relevant issue to her deciding whether or not she wants this relationship, and concealing it is definitely not ethical.

Bring it up. Tell her that you don't have to push it now, but it's going to have to be part of your life.  Then she can decide if it's worth the price of admission to be with you.

I have some swinging friends that, when they first got together, he expressed interest in swinging.  She said ""ask me again in 20 years"".  They had lots of hot, monogamous sex together for 20 years, then he asked her again.

You almost certainly can't go back to thinking that monogamy really matters. Can you be monogamous as the price of admission to be with this girl?  If not, why do you think you can ask her to be non monogamous as price of admission for you?

And let's be real. Here are the possibilities:

* You bring it up and talk her into swinging. She thinks it's awesome and you live happily ever after with the perfect girl.
* You bring it up and talk her into swinging. She's miserable and it builds resentment until you split up.
* You bring it up and can't talk her into it. You double down. She dumps you.
* You bring it up and can't talk her into it. You decide to be monogamous because she's so awesome. You end up miserable and it builds resentment until you split up.
* You bring it up and can't talk her into it. You decide to be monogamous because she's so awesome. You live happily ever after, but always with the knowledge that you're not experiencing something that was cool.

The odds of the first case don't seem all that high.

You're doing neither you nor her any favors by keeping it under wraps now.  Yes, it sucks to find someone that's almost perfect, but that almost is a deal breaker.  But it sucks a lot less than splitting up with one or the other party feeling betrayed.  And if you get into the classic ""two children and house with white picket fence"", well, a divorce with kids involved sucks even more.

Don't set yourself or her up for failure.",woodysmith1912,1686817371.0

newhampshire,"I agree to some extent, but it‚Äôs not a one size fits all scenario.

I grew up without a wealthy family.  My dad was a manager at Dunkin Donuts and my mom was a part time secretary.  I learned to be frugal and only buy what I needed to get by. We didn‚Äôt have cable tv or any other luxuries.  Today I own a TV, but I don‚Äôt have cable, Netflix, Hulu, or anything‚ÄîI still feel guilty buying anything that involves a subscription.  My phone bill is $30/month, and my hobbies include hiking and reading.  With a college degree, a little luck, and not knowing anything but a frugal lifestyle I‚Äôm a literal millionaire.

On the opposite end of the spectrum I met someone recently who unfortunately lost his job due to layoffs.  He has an expensive car payment on a new Lexus, eats out all the time, and has a really fancy Louis Vuitton wallet.  Somehow he has no equity in the car so he can‚Äôt even sell it ‚Äî apparently he owned another Luxus that he still paying off which he traded up for this one. He had $0 in savings with a 3 week severance package and said he was 3 weeks from going bankrupt and losing evening.  His salary was around $50k.

Purely my anecdotal millennial experience, but I think we get accustomed to a lifestyle and that becomes the norm.  If someone was just barely getting by I think you could look at these money vacuums, but there comes a point where you‚Äôre buried so deep that it wouldn‚Äôt make much of a difference.

PPC,"Hey there!  
  
If you have an Android app on Google Play that shows ads to users and makes money from purchases, you're thinking about creating a Google Ads campaign to get more people to install your app. You also want to improve your app's rankings on the Google Play store, which have dropped recently for no clear reason.  
  
The problem is that most campaign types in Google Ads require you to pay for clicks or installs, which may not match the revenue you make from ads in your app. However, a campaign type called CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) could work for you. It focuses on getting your ads seen by people, even if they don't click or install your app right away.  
  
A CPM campaign with banners on websites can help you increase awareness about your app and reach a larger audience. Although it might not directly lead to more installs, it can make more people aware of your app, which could eventually result in more people downloading it and earning you more money.  
  
If you're specifically looking to drive installs or clicks, you may want to explore other campaign types like CPI (cost-per-install) or CPC (cost-per-click). These campaigns are designed to target users who are more likely to download your app or interact with your ads.  
  
It's important to analyze your app's data and user behavior to decide which campaign type is best for your goals and budget. By trying different types of campaigns, monitoring their performance, and using data to make decisions, you can improve your advertising strategy and get better results.  
  
If you need help planning and running your Google Ads campaign for your app, you can reach out to Infinity Web Solutions. They're experts in online advertising and digital marketing and can give you valuable advice to make your campaign successful. Just visit their website at www.infinitywebsolutions.com.

rpg_gamers,"I'm having fun with a shadow daggers bladedancer. Spec into Shift, Umbral Blades, Synchronised Strike, Shadow Cascade, and Smoke Bomb. The playstyle is to dash around which auto-clears packs, then on a boss you drop a smoke bomb and synchronised strike before dashing away.

The above skills are used to apply shadow daggers to enemies. Shadow daggers proc and hit the enemy once 4 daggers are applied, and shadow daggers ALWAYS CRIT. What this means is we just need to stack sources of shadow daggers and crit multi but we don't need to worry about getting crit capped.

To apply the daggers we use:

Umbral Blades - Spec into lethal darkness and loathing. This turns your blades into a large spinning blade that constantly applies daggers. We don't want to cast this manually though so we take umbral remnant which makes our shadows drop blades. 

This means we want a lot of shadows so we use Shift and Synchronised Strike. 

Shift - Spec into dancing shadows. This will drop a shadow when you dash which will then drop an umbral blade to apply daggers. You'll also trigger shadow cascade when dashing which we'll also use to apply shadow daggers. Just shifting around is good enough for clear, then for a single target boost we use Synchronised Strike.

Synchronised Strike - Get perfect coordination so that all your strike shadows can hit a single enemy then take umbral assassination to apply daggers with strike. Take dark allies for even more shadows and daggers. This takes a lot of mana though so to regen mana we use shadow cascade.

Shadow Cascade - You can't cast this yourself since you're not dual-wielding so instead we cast this on Shift. Spec into fight in the shadows for all your mana needs. Spec into shadow elegance to help with clear and apply more daggers.

Smoke Bomb - Spec into knives in the dark for even more (you guessed it!) shadow daggers. Or if you're feeling squishy use smoke bomb for defenses.

On your tree and gear you want:
Defenses - Life, res, dodge. Make sure to get one point in argent veil on the tree. This gives you silver shroud which is a 1-hit cheat death. We only need one point because we don't care about the ward.
Damage scaling - Phys damage, crit multi, throwing damage, melee damage. These will scale your shadow dagger crits which is all we care about.",S3Ni0r42,1686814853.0

Try these:

*""West With the Night""* by Beryl Markham. Markham was a friend of Hemingway, but Hemingway can intimidate new readers so try this woman writer. There's no way you can possibly be daunted by a female author, right? Right. Anyway what makes this real-life dame interesting is that she was an early aviation pioneer and she flew mail delivery planes in Africa. Biplanes, early monoplanes. She was one of the first and she was ferocious. Crash landing her plane over and over, sometimes in the desert, or the jungle, dealing with natives; dust storms; wild animals.

Another:

*""Sailing Alone Around the World""* by Joshua Slocum. Slocum is a genuine American hero. He's in the world record books. First guy ever, to sail alone by himself in a sailboat, completely around the globe. This experiment of his, took place in the late 1800s. Effin' fascinating. He's a good writer and he describes in detail all the shyt he had to do to stay alive 25000 miles completely on his own.

Maybe it's your attitude though which made them not cooperative. Threatening that you might be quitting is tough. And even if you didn't say these words to them, it does appear that you show them ""aggressively"" how you think about the band because this is all against your principles. 

Truth be told, you might be shoveling your own grave right now. If they feel like you're ""that guy"" and if you threat with leaving them before a show they might just start to look for a replacement for you. 

Also, merch seller is not necessarily crew. Your light-/audio staff, etc, is crew. Merch selling is your extra money - some people include them, some don't.

It's why Ari's nonsense make sense to me because he was basically trying to recreate that kind of promo and reputation with Ilia. It's really hard to find promotional materials from back then, but even recently as SOI 2023 Japanese fans mentioned that in the past, promoting that certain skaters can do quads in an ice show, a rarity to attract fans, used to be a thing. But it isn't now (probably because more and more skaters are doing that) so they took note of that. I know this because Shoma Japanese fans were talking about it since Shoma was getting attacked for doing 2As and 3S in his SOI programs at first, sayjng he doesn't care about fans because he only did easy jumps. So Shoma Japanese fans were wondering since he did quads in the previous off season, but it wasn't covered much in the news unlike in the past when it wad a promotion point.",rabidline,1686815415.0

Just something basic like ""Special named locations"", where you could get special items, loot and such would have been a great addition. The personal hideout is another big one. And the ability to have your army target a specific enemy formation made life much easier. 

Viking Conquest also had an actual story in the game, and based on how you played things, the story made a huge difference in how your game ended up being.

SSBM,"Armada is by far the GOAT of Melee, having actually perfect knowledge over most of the characters and having mastered and won multiple tournaments with two of them; he only lost to the very best of the best, and they to this day can be counted with the fingers in your hand. 

Armada was so good there is multiple video compilations of people from top 50 that ‚ÄúALMOST WON‚Äù against armada, and sets taken from him. People took pride in taking a single set from him. And he never dropped a game to anyone below top 8.

It was so rare to see him in losers brackets that commentators would spend half the match talking about it, because if armada entered a tournament, he‚Äôd be on winners and either win or end on second (there was a long period of years were he won first consecutively, not a single tournament dropped. This has never been done again)

Armada reached the top with one of the hardest characters in melee, point proven by the fact that there is no other peach prevalent in the scene since he retired, and to double prove his mastery of neutral and the game itself, he also won multiple tournaments with Fox. He won using both the lowest of the S tier and the highest as well.

People like to argue there‚Äôs some people that could top armada‚Äôs legacy. There is absolutely no way that‚Äôs happening. And if he remained playing the game, he‚Äôd still be top 1, I cannot understand why anyone would doubt that. Armada only left because he was down with the game, the toxicity of fans, and because of his own mentioned frustration and depression.

The programming is also generally easier and won‚Äôt let you fault controllers.

PLCs though are fantastic for mission critical or machine applications where the process needs high IO density and needs to do a lot of repetitive tasks quickly.

In your hypothetical question you assume that the motor is causing a positional error of 0.2mm. That would be the equivalent of a full step or per your example 3600 micro steps over target. The positional step error is non cumulative from one step to another so if we take the usual 5% angle accuracy we should only get a deviation of +-0.01mm.

30% is too much, and the main complaint wasn't really power. It was stated bloat. Doom orb getting pen when it's entire identity and purpose is a movements speed item.

They needed to make items being more unique and individually powerful, instead of all of them bring large stat sticks with power movement speed, pen and other stats all on 1 item.

We still have stat bloat now, pendulum with 20cdr, doom orb with pen  warlocks with pen when it should be a health items and so on.

A 10% nerf would've brought power back down to its historical level, then we could've nerfed some stat bloat items and make builds more of a choice  i stead of getting  everything you need in 1 build.

urbanplanning,"There may be other things going on that aren't obvious; flood mitigation, for example, can require a surprising amount of surface area, and sometimes that area can be kinda double-purposed as a parking lot or something else.

My dad visited me recently and we were out shopping, and he pointed at a nice little park area with benches, set in an indent in the middle of the parking lot with staircases leading to it, and said ""weird, why is this in the parking lot"", and I said ""yeah, that entire park area ends up six feet underwater if storms come, that's the only reason it exists, it's a stormwater buffer; they tossed some benches in to make it look prettier"".

(It worked, though, it really does look nice. Full marks there.)

Another thing that can happen is that they buy more land than they need with the expectation of expanding later. What do you do with it in the short-term, though? Well, if you turn it into a park, you end up with protests and eminent domain lawsuits if you ever try to bulldoze it and turn it into buildings . . . so you turn it into a parking lot instead, because nobody desperately tries to save a parking lot.",ZorbaTHut,1686815156.0

Hanap ka ng maluwag and definitely not busy na kalsada or parking lot (it may not work sa city).  Have the student drive in reverse in a very slow steady speed. Assuming an auto transmission, let the student step off the brake without stepping on the gas. While moving on reverse, tell the student to turn the wheel one way and then straighten the wheel back. Turn the wheel again to the opposite direction and straighten the wheel again. 

It's very normal to get disoriented when driving backwards/reverse. Us humans are not really used to moving backwards. It throws off our spatial awareness and sense of direction when we do it. The best thing to do is to just keep doing it hanggang masanay o maging komportable yung tinuturuan mo. Practice makes perfect.

cheating_stories,"Your wife deserves better than you and her supposed best friend, what you've both done and are planning to do is disgusting. You have both, already and are choosing to do more damage to her when she will eventually find out and she will whether sooner or later. And when she does you lose everything. 
A true friend would not kiss, sleep with or do anything that could be seen as inappropriate with you. If you truly love your wife, or even care or respect her just a little you would come clean and keep the 'best friend' out of her life and yours, issue resolved already, your welcome. Or leave her and give her the chance to be with a man that truly deserves her, because if you do this won't bean issue that needs resolving. Cheating is a choice you make, sleeping with the friend won't resolve anything just start something. You are giving another woman power over your relationship with your wife. Make the right choice all I'm reading are excuses ""100x worse if she's told"" thats because you'd be forced to face your shame, the pain you've caused. Have the decency to not make a bad situation worse right now with it only being a kiss you have a marginally better chance of saving your marriage.

thenetherlands,"Je hebt zeker een punt dat die studie niet alles zegt. Ik denk ook dat de harde wetenschap hier voor jongeren niet zoveel uitmaakt, als wel de perceptie van die wetenschap. Elke keer weer blijkt dat klimaatverandering veel sneller gaat dan we origineel dachten, en er is duidelijk meer extreem weer de laatste 5-10 jaar; dat zijn dingen die bij mensen toch echt wel binnenkomen. Als een persoon denkt dat het klimaat problematisch gaat zijn, kan dit al reden genoeg zijn om geen kinderen te krijgen.

Ook denk ik dat voor veel jongere mensen het beeld dat we 'kinderen moeten krijgen zodat de economie/pensioenen blijft draaien/ ik iemand heb om voor me te zorgen als ik oud ben' echt in het verkeerde keelgat schiet. Het wordt steeds duidelijker dat de huidige mate van kapitalisme en het geilen op eindeloze economische groei gewoon niet houdbaar op de lange termijn is. Ikzelf vind het dan nogal zelfzuchtig om die dingen als redenen aan te halen om kinderen te krijgen. Zeker ook het sentiment 'als ik niet de wereld voor mijn kinderen red, voor wie red ik het dan wel?' vind ik zelf ook vrij zelf-zuchtig.

Make sure to include that information in your contract(s). If you hire for commecial work via this subreddit - it is NOT considered ""Work-for-hire"" (17 U.S.C. ¬ß 101) but instead work from an ""independent contractor."" Make sure your prices and contract reflect that. 

We have additional info and links in the wiki https://www.reddit.com/r/HungryArtists/wiki/index about pricing for commercial work, but your moderators would strongly recommend users to look at the Graphic Artist's Guild Handbook of Pricing and Ethical Guidelines and other similar guides to get an understanding on what the average pricing is for professional projects .

The average hourly rate is *$25-38 USD* per hour for artists and designers according to The US Department of Labor Occupational Labor Statistics for 2020. This rate does not include usage rights.

singing,"I think your opinion could be true, in theory üòÑ

A lot of the time and especially for intermediate level singers however, pitch issues are not about the singer not knowing which note they want to hit or not trying hard enough to hit the right pitch 

Rather they are about not being proficient enough at things like having a nice and steady air flow or an efficient support

So trying to fix those particular issues only with a pitch training app is at best a quick fix and and at worst something that will make you learn bad habits

I do agree that it is a great tool for beginners whose pitch is all over the place or to really fine tune your pitch once your technique is good enough üëç",lesinsectessontamis,1686819942.0

fiveguys,"I started at $11 in 2015, minimum wage was still $8. By 2018 I was at $14.50, so basically $1 raise a year. My first store was the lowest earning store in the whole city (Montague street in Brooklyn heights, now closed). They could only afford to have 1 SL and 2 crew on shift at a time, instead of the mandatory 4 person team, so I had to work 2 stations at a time on top of QC. When I went to bigger stores such as Metrotech, 14th street, 34th street, and 3rd Ave near grand central, I was always on the fry station and also QC-ed from there because I could oversee the whole kitchen from that position. When I did have to jump in to help on toppings or grill, I always tried to leave at least the next 3 orders of fries prepped for bagging. Biggest sales hour at my first slow store was between $500-700, usually $1,200-1,700 for the whole night (I took morning classes so I was mainly a closer). At other bigger stores, busiest hour ranged from $800-1,100 and $1,900-2,700 for the whole night. Busiest night I ever work was July 4th; $5,000 for the whole night with a 5 person crew. It was so bad, my GM had to come in tipsy from a cookout to help with the rush and help close.

I too feel uncomfortable with excess gold, but I always find some way to put it to use when I really need it, such as a quick unit. Get the necessary civics for corps and armies, you can burn through your gold quicker and end up with more powerful units that help control the your neighbors. Excess gold is a great problem to have!",breadwardmatoasty,1686827689.0
horrorlit,"Vintage Britpulp can sometimes be on the guilty side of pleasure for me. I love it for the fast pacing, the lack of pretension and the frequent glorious and gruesome lunacy, and for being reminded of my childhood as I grew up on James Herbert, Shaun Hutson and so forth from the local library or charity shops. But sometimes the plot construction or writing in general can be, frankly, not very good. Also, though I'm not exactly a prude, bleeding heart etc. (the relationship between my socio-political views in reality and my tastes in print and screen is complicated), and I'm sure that in the main old pulp horror writers weren't airing genuine problems with women, other races, queer people and so forth, sometimes things can get a little skeevy for me. Like, say, Guy N Smith's novel Abomination has its bonkers merits, but definitely left a sexist / transphobic bad taste.",Blue_Tomb,1686828593.0

The vocal line gifting things to ensure their leader will be able to maintain good vocal conditions. Taerae with his mini megaphone and laughing at it even... And the giant throat candy box... It is so endearing how Hanbin is always calling Zhang Hao his other half. I like their dynamics. Generally, zb1 seems to be growing really close as a whole

Matthew and Rickys presents are so obvious because of how they write. It is cute how Matthew really looks up to Hanbin. Rickys neck massager is probably very useful for stressful times.

12 raw for the endgame weapons all have around 280 - 300 raw (not counting the most powerful set of weapons)  so you get around 4% more damage after crit boost (if it even applies before crit boost which I don't remember)

Also I tried mixing the nyx can't stop won't stop foundation (which I hate) with the ABH luminous foundation (which is too dark) and I love it??  It looks and feels just like the Estee lauder double wear.  It's so nice.  So this will be my go to summer at home combo until they run out.  The ELDW will be my travel and fancy occasion summer foundation (until the other two run out, then it'll be my every day summer foundation.) For ratio it's two pumps nyx, one pump ABH.  Im glad I tried this on a whim because it's awesome.  Once the Estee lauder is gone I may repurchase the ABH and nyx because they'll last longer and be cheaper over the long run.  I think anyway.  Idk.

- a Hunter plot led by a very old Thinblood
- a Redlister

If people read around, they will find people saying that during certain waves the throat is the first area to show virus.  I think it was big during a later omicron wave to get a sore throat and a negative test with a nose swab but positive on a throat swab.

Reinstall both integrated as well as dedicated drivers and ensure that windows update do not alter or revert the drivers (I highly recommmend to disable Windows Update to automatically update graphics drivers).",NaturalElegantKEZE,1686830515.0
